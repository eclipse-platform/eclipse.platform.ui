<h2>
<b>Example - Java Editor</b></h2>

<h3>
Introduction</h3>
The Java Editor example demonstrates the standard features available for
custom text editors.&nbsp; It also shows how&nbsp; to register an editor
for a file extension (in this case .jav) and how to define a custom Document
provider for use by that editor. This example is only for demonstration
purposes. Java editing support is provided by the&nbsp; Eclipse Java Tooling.
<h3>
<b>Features demonstrated in the example editor</b></h3>

<ul>
<li>
syntax highlighting</li>

<li>
content type sensitive content assist (JavaDoc and Java code)</li>

<li>
communication between content outliner and editor, i.e. content outliner
selection feeds the highlight range of the editor</li>

<li>
two different presentation modes</li>

<ul>
<li>
&nbsp;marking the highlight range using a visual range indicator</li>

<li>
confining the editor to show only text within the highlight range (e.g.
show a single method of a Java class)</li>
</ul>

<li>
marker handling</li>

<li>
document sharing</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Features not demonstrated</h3>

<ul>
<li>
content formatting</li>

<li>
dynamic reconciling of content outline page</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Running the example editor</h3>

<ol>
<li>
Create a project</li>

<li>
Create a file with the file extension ".jav" in the newly created project.
The Java example editor opens automatically.</li>

<li>
Insert Java code. The Java code is dynamically colored. The example editor
presents the following language elements in different colors: multi-line
comments, single line comments, Java language reserved words, string and
character constants, regular Java code, as well as multi-line comments
following the JavaDoc guidelines. Inside those JavaDoc comments, JavaDoc
keywords and tags are differently colored.</li>

<li>
Open a new Java multi-line comment by inserting "/*" outside a Java comment.
All the text between the inserted "/*" and the first occurrence of "*/"
or the end of the text changes its color to red. Append another "*". The
red range changes color to green as the regular multi-line comment now
is considered containing JavaDoc. Invoke code assist using CTRL-SPACE.
The function of content assist is to support the user in writing code.
So on invocation, content assist should list all possible valid completions
at the invocation location. Inside JavaDoc, the example editor always proposes
all JavaDoc keywords.</li>

<li>
Outside a Java comment invoke content tip using CTRL+SHIFT+SPACE. Five
proposals are listed. Select one and press ENTER. A small floating red
window appears above the current line displaying the selected proposal.
The anticipated use of content tips is to let the user express her intention,
e.g. to enter a method call and to present contextual information which
guides the user by doing so. In the example editor, the proposal is considered
valid five characters around the initial invocation location. While the
content tip is visible, invoke content assist using CTRL+SPACE. Content
assist invoked in this situation should help the user to accomplish her
stated intention visible in the content tip. Inside regular Java code,
the example editor always proposes all Java keywords.</li>

<li>
Save the Java code. Saving updates the content outliner. The content outliner
contains ten entries each of them representing one of ten equally sized
segments of the Java code in the editor. This style of content outline
has been chosen to show that the semantics of highlight ranges can arbitrarily
be defined. (See next steps.)</li>

<li>
Select one of the entries in the content outliner. The corresponding lines
are marked with a blue bar in the editor's left vertical ruler.</li>

<li>
Now switch to the segmented presentation mode of the Java editor. For that
make sure that the editor has the focus and press that button in the desktop's
toolbar whose hover help says "Enable/Disable segmented source viewer".&nbsp;
This functionality is anticipated to be used, e.g., for single method views.</li>

<li>
Select a different entry in the content outliner. Now the editor only shows
the selected segment. By deselecting the entry in the content outliner,
the complete Java code is shown again.</li>

<li>
Select an entry in the content outliner, select a fraction of the visible
text, and add a task for the selection. The task shows up in the task list.
Modify the visible code. In the task list, select the previously created
task and press the "Go to file" button. The task is selected in the visible
area, correctly taking the previously applied modifications into account.</li>

<li>
Select another entry in the content outliner. Reveal the previously added
task from the task list. The editor's highlight range is automatically
enlarged to enclose the range of the revealed task.</li>

<li>
Open a new workspace. In the new workspace, open a Java editor for the
same file as in the original workspace. Modify the editor content. Switch
back to the original workspace. The editor shows the changes made in the
other workspace. The two editors showing the same file are lively linked.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
Principles for creating custom text editors</h3>
The following steps are usually necessary do develop a custom text editor.
<ol>
<li>
Create a document provider. A document provider (see IDocumentProvider)
produces and manages documents (see IDocument) containing a textual representation
of editor input elements. It is important to decide how the translation
between element and textual representation looks like and whether the document
provider should be shared between multiple editors or not. See the class
FileDocumentProvider in the Java example editor.</li>

<li>
Create a document partitioner. A document partitioner (see IDocumentPartitioner)
divides a document into disjoint regions. The partitioner assigns each
region one content type out of a set of content types predefined by the
partitioner. On each document change the document's partitioning must be
updated. See the class JavaPartitioner in the Java example editor. The
JavaPartitioner determines regions of the types multi-line comments, JavaDoc
comments, and everything else. It must be ensured that the document provider
is set on each document produced by the document provider.</li>

<li>
Determine which of the source viewer plugins should be provided. Among
other supported plugins are auto indent strategies, double click strategies,
content formatter, and text presentation reconciler. The subsequent description
will be restricted to the text presentation reconciler (see IPresentationReconciler).
In the Java example editor, the text presentation reconciler is utilized
to implement syntax highlighting.</li>

<li>
Create for all source viewer plugins the appropriate extensions for each
supported content type. As seen above, the document partitioner defines
the supported content types. The default implementation of IPresentationReconciler
supports IPresentationDamagers and IPresentationRepairers as extensions.
Those extensions are considered being specific for a particular content
type. Thus, for a custom editor, the user must first select a subset of
the supported content types. Regions of a type being a member of the selected
subset will, e.g., be syntax highlighted. For each of those types the extensions
must be implemented. See JavaDamagerRepairer and JavaDocDamagerRepairer
in the example editor.</li>

<li>
Build a source viewer configuration using the previously created plugins
and extensions. See JavaSourceViewerConfiguration in the example editor.</li>

<li>
Customize the class TextEditor or AbstractTextEditor with the developed
document partitioner and source viewer configuration. Add or replace actions
and adapt the construction of the editor's context menu. In the actual
version, this customization must be done in a subclass. See JavaEditor
in the example editor.</li>

<li>
Set up an appropriate action bar contributor who contributes editor-related
actions to the desktop's toolbar and menus. See JavaActionContributor in
the example editor.</li>

<li>
Extend the XML configuration file of the editor's plugin, so that the editor
registers at the predefined editor extension point for a specific set of
file extensions. Also set up the action bar contributor in the XML file.
See plugin.xml of this example.</li>
</ol>

<h3>
Code organization of the example</h3>
The example code is organized in four packages:
<ul>
<li>
<tt>org.eclipse.ui.examples.javaeditor </tt>contains all the editor specific
classes.</li>

<li>
<tt>org.eclipse.ui.examples.javaeditor.java</tt> contains all Java specific
source viewer plugins such as the JavaDamagerRepairer as well as the Java
specific document partitioner.</li>

<li>
<tt>org.eclipse.ui.examples.javaeditor.javadoc </tt>contains all JavaDoc
specific source viewer plugins such as the JavaDocDamagerRepairer.</li>

<br><tt>org.eclipse.ui.examples.javaeditor.util</tt> contains convenience
classes shared by the three other packages.</ul>
