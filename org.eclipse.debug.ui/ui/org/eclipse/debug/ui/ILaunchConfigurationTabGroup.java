/**
 * A launch configuration tab group is used to edit/view attributes
 * of a specific type of launch configuration. Launch
 * configurations are presented in a dialog, with a tab folder.
 * Each tab manipulates one or more attributes of a launch
 * configuration. The tab group controls which tabs are
 * displayed for a specific type of launch configuration,
 * and provides a mechanism for overriding configuration
 * initialization performed by tabs.
 * <p>
 * A tab group has the following lifecycle methods:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>createTabs(ILaunchConfigurationDialog, String)</code> - 
 *  this is the first method called on a tab group after it is instantiated.</li>
 * <li><code>initializeFrom(ILaunchConfiguration)</code> - called when a 
 *  launch configuration is selected to be displayed.</li>
 * <li><code>performApply(ILaunchConfigurationWorkingCopy)</code> - called when
 *  a tab group's values are to be written to a launch configuration.</li>
 * <li><code>dispose()</code> - the last method called on a tab group, when it is
 *  to perform any required cleanup. Note that a tab can be disposed before its control
 *  has been created.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The method <code>setDefaults(ILaunchConfigurationWorkingCopy)</code>
 * can be called before a tab's controls are created.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The launch tab framework was originally designed to handle inter tab
 * communication by applying attributes from the active tab to a launch configuration
 * being edited, when a tab is exited, and by initializing a tab when activated.
 * In 3.0, the addition of the methods <code>activated</code> and <code>deactivated</code>
 * allow tabs to determine the appropriate course of action. The default implementation
 * in <code>AbstractLaunchConfigurationTab</code> is to call the old methods
 * (<code>initializeFrom</code> and <code>performApply</code>). Tabs should override
 * the new methods as required.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A launch configuration group extension is defined in <code>plugin.xml</code>.
 * Following is an example definition of a launch configuration
 * group extension.
 * <pre>
 * &lt;extension point="org.eclipse.debug.ui.launchConfigurationTabGroups"&gt;
 *   &lt;launchConfigurationTabGroup 
 *      id="com.example.ExampleTabGroup"
 *      type="com.example.ExampleLaunchConfigurationTypeIdentifier"
 *      class="com.example.ExampleLaunchConfigurationTabGroupClass"&gt;
 *   &lt;/launchConfigurationTabGroup&gt;
 * &lt;/extension&gt;
 * </pre>
 * The attributes are specified as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>id</code> specifies a unique identifier for this launch configuration
 *  tab group.</li>
 * <li><code>type</code> specifies launch configuration type that this tab
 *  group is applicable to (corresponds to the id of a launch configuration type
 *  extension).</li>
 * <li><code>class</code> specifies a fully qualified name of a Java class
 *  that implements <code>ILaunchConfigurationTabGroup</code>.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is intended to be implemented by clients.
 * </p>
