<p>Provides a generic debugger user interface that clients may customize via standard
workbench extension points.</p>

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: this package is part of an interim API that is still under
development and expected to change significantly before reaching stability. It is being
made available at this early stage to soloicit feedback from pioneering adopters on the
understanding that any code that uses this API will almost certainly be broken
(repeatedly) as the API evolves.</p>

<p>Eclipse Debug Tools UI (debug UI plug-in) provides a set of classes and interfaces to
support a debugger user interface. A generic debug perspective is provided with a common
set of views. Clients are allowed to contribute actions to the debug views via the
standard workbench <font face="Courier New">viewAction</font> extension point, and can
contribute to popup menus in the debug views via the standard <font face="Courier New">popupMenu</font>
extension point.</p>

<h4>The Debug View</h4>

<p>The debug view presents a tree of launched debug sessions. The view provides support
for standard debug interactions such as terminating, stepping, suspending, and resuming
threads and debug targets. The debug view is linked to an editor view, variable view, and
console. The editor view is used to display source code for stack frames. A selection in
the debug view causes the line of code being executed to be highlighted in the editor
view. The variable view shows the visible variables in the selected stack frame, and the
console view handles I/O for the debuggable process.</p>

<h4>The Process View</h4>

<p>The process view presents a tree of launched programs in normal (non-debug) mode. The
view provides support for terminating processes, and is linked to the console view to
support I/O.</p>

<h4>The Variable View</h4>

<p>The variable view presents a tree of variables for the currently selected stack frame.</p>

<h4>The Breakpoint View</h4>

<p>The breakpoint view presents a list of all breakpoints currently defined in the
workspace. It supports enabling/disabling and breakpoint removal.</p>

<h4>The Inspector View</h4>

<p>The inspector view presents a tree of expressions that have been evaluated.</p>

<h4>Debug Model Presentation</h4>

<p>The debug UI plug-in defines an extension (<font face="Courier New">org.eclipse.debug.ui.debugModelPresentations</font>)
point to allow implementations of debug models to provide custom rendering and
presentation of its debug elements. Extensions are be registered for a specific debug
model. It is intended that an implementation of a debug model will also provide an
implementation of a debug model presentation. The presentation provides: 

<ul>
  <li>an image for a debug element or breakpoint</li>
  <li>a label for a debug element or breakpoint</li>
  <li>an editor input and editor id used to display the debug element or breakpoint</li>
</ul>

<h4>Launch Wizard</h4>

<p>The debug UI plug-in defines an interface that launch wizards must implement - <font
face="Courier New">org.eclipse.debug.ui.ILaunchWizard</font>. Launch wizards are defined
in <font face="Courier New">launcher</font> extensions (defined by <font
face="Courier New">org.eclipse.debug.core</font>), and are instantiated by the debug UI
plug-in.</p>

<h4>Debug Perspective</h4>

<p>By default, when a program is run or debug, the debug UI automatically switches to the
default debug perspective. To circumvent automatic perspective switching, a user
preference is available. Launcher extensions may also define an alternate perspective to
use.</p>
