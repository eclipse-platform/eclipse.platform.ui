/**
 * Interface used to tag objects as launchable. Objects that provide
 * an adapter of this type will be considered by the contextual
 * launch support. 
 * <p>
 * The debug platform uses the {@link ILaunchable} interface as a tag for
 * objects that can be launched via the context menu 'Run As / Debug As' actions
 * and run/debug tool bar buttons. The platform checks if an {@link ILaunchable}
 * adapter is available from the selection/active editor to determine if it
 * should be considered for launching. However, the platform never actually
 * retrieves the adapter or calls any methods on it (the interface is, in fact, empty).
 * </p>
 * <p>The debug platform performs the following test:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <code>Platform.getAdapterManager().hasAdapter(X, ILaunchable.class.getName());</code>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Thus objects that can be launched need to register {@link ILaunchable} adapters, but
 * don't have to provide implementations. There is also no harm in implementing the interface
 * or providing the adapter. For example, JDT contributes an adapter as follows. Although
 * no adapter is actually provided the platform will answer <code>true</code> to 
 * <code>hasAdapter(...)</code>.
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * <extension point="org.eclipse.core.runtime.adapters">

 *       class="" 
 *       adaptableType="org.eclipse.jdt.core.IJavaElement">
 *       <adapter type="org.eclipse.debug.ui.actions.ILaunchable"/>
 *   </factory>
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Clients may contribute an adapter of this type for launchable objects
 * via the <code>org.eclipse.core.runtime.adapters</code> extension
 * point. A factory and implementation of this interface are not actually
 * required.
