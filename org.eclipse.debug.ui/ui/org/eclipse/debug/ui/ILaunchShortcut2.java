/**
 * <p>
 * An extension to a standard launch shortcut ({@link ILaunchShortcut}) allowing 
 * launch shortcuts to specify how selections and editors should be launched.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To launch a selection (or active editor), the debug platform derives a resource associated
 * with the selection (or active editor), and then resolves the most recently launched configuration
 * associated with that resource. This interface allows a launch shortcut to override the 
 * framework's resource and launch configuration resolution for selections (and active editors).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * NOTE: the methods in this interface can be called in a <b>non-UI</b> thread.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Clients contributing a launch shortcut are intended to implement this interface.
 * </p>
 * @see org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.contextlaunching.ContextRunner
 * @see org.eclipse.debug.internal.ui.contextlaunching.LaunchingResourceManager
