<h2 align="left">Package Specification</h2>

<p>This package provides a set interfaces and classes to manage debug contexts.</p>
<p>A debug context represents an active state of a program being debugged. The 
  active debug context drives the enabled state of debug actions (step, terminate, 
  etc.), source lookup, visible variables, watch expression values, etc. The debug 
  platform allows clients to register for context change notification in order 
  to respond to changes in the active debug state, as well as register context 
  providers that drive the active debug state. The debug platform has context 
  listeners and providers itself. For example, the debug platform's stepping actions 
  register for context change notification to update enabled state and the Debug 
  view registers as a context provider.</p>
<p>There can be any number of debug contexts within a workbench window, but at 
  any one time there is only one active debug context within a part and one active 
  context within a workbench window. The debug platform provides a debug context 
  service per window (<code>IDebugContextService</code>) that allows clients to 
  register context providers for that window, and register for change notification 
  within the window or a specific part in the window. If there is only one context 
  provider in a window, it provides the context for the entire window as well 
  as its part. If there is more than one context provider for a window, the context 
  provider associated with the most recently active part provides the context 
  for that window. It is possible to register a context provider that has no associated 
  part. Only one such context provider can be registered with each service (window). 
  A context provider that has no associated part provides context for its window 
  only if there are no other context providers registered for that window.</p>
<p>A debug context is represented by a selection (<code>ISelection</code>). This 
  allows for single or multi-element selections as well as text selections to 
  provide context. Listeners are notified of context changes with debug context 
  events (<code>DebugContextEvent</code>) . An event specifies the context that 
  has changed and a bit mask describing how the context has changed. The platform 
  defines two types of changes - activation and state change. An activated state 
  indicates a new context - for example a thread suspending at a breakpoint or 
  after a step. An activation triggers variables to refresh, source lookup, etc. 
  A state change indicates that a previously activated state has changed. For 
  example, a stack frame or thread that was activated has completed an implicit 
  evaluation. A state change triggers action enabled states to update.</p>
