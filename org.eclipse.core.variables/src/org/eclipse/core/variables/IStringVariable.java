/**
 * A variable that can be referenced in an expression, which resolves to a string
 * value. Variables are referenced in expressions via their name, in the following
 * format.
 * <pre>
 * ${varname} or ${varname:argument}
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * A variable is identified by its name, and optionally accepts an argument. When an
 * argument is present, a colon separates the variable name from its argument.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Variables can be contributed by extensions or programmatically. There are two
 * kinds of variables.
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>IValueVariable</code> - variables that have a value (with getter and setter), and
 *       accept no arguments. The value of this type of variable is resolved at the time
 *       its value is set via its setter API.</li>
 * <li><code>IDynamicVariable</code> - variables whose value is resolved at the time
 * 		a string substitution is performed by a contributed resolver. Dynamic variables
 * 		may accept an argument.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
