Provides core support for the Eclipse platform online
help system.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
There is a general mechanism (defined at the plug-in level) by which individual
plug-ins contribute online help and context-sensitive help for their component.
The help system UI is responsible for accessing this information and displaying
it to the user.
<p>The actual help system UI implementation is an optional piece that plugs
in to the platform's standard <tt>org.eclipse.help.support</tt> extension
point. At most one such help system UI should be contributed in any given
configuration of the platform. In general terms, implementing a help system
UI involves:
<ul>
<li>
Implementing the <tt>IHelp</tt> interface to display help to the user.</li>

<li>
Declaring an extension of the <tt>org.eclipse.help.support</tt> extension
point that mentions the name of that class.</li>

<li>
Ensuring that the platform is not configured with any other plug-ins which
contribute to the <tt>org.eclipse.help.support</tt> extension point.</li>
</ul>
Note that the platform declares a plug-in (<tt>org.eclipse.help.workbench</tt>)
which implements the help system UI. This plug-in would need to be omitted
from the platform configuration when using a replacement.
