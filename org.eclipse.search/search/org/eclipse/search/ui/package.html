Provides classes and interfaces for search pages.
New search dialog pages can be contributed via a plug-in extension point.
This package provides the interfaces and classes to implement these dialog
pages and offers hooks to populate the search result view.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
Each search dialog page must implement <tt>ISearchPage</tt>. A search page
has access to its container (<tt>ISearchPageContainer</tt>) to modify search
dialog properties. The class <tt>SearchUI</tt> can activate the search
results view and provide access to the active search results view (<tt>ISearchResultView</tt>).
<p>It is the clients responsibility to create a marker for each match and
then report the match to the search result view together with a key (<tt>groupByKey</tt>).
Each key corresponds to a search result view entry (<tt>ISearchResultViewEntry</tt>)
which allows to step through the markers grouped by the key.
