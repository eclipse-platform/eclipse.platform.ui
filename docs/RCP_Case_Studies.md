# Commercial Rich client platform (RCP) applications

*This content was archived from https://www.eclipse.org/community/rcpcp.php (last captured February 12, 2024)*

This page contains links to applications built on the Eclipse Rich Client Platform (RCP). The listings here are intended to get you started in finding out more about products and projects that use the Eclipse RCP. You can also view a pdf presentation of RCP based applications.

We have also prepared some case studies of organizations that are using Eclipse RCP. Hopefully it will provide you a better understanding of the benefits from using Eclipse RCP for your application platform.

We'd like these pages to be useful to you - so please email us your pointers and comments!

## Commercial RCP Applications

### AB ZealCore System Debugger

![AB ZealCore System Debugger Screenshot](images/rcp_case_studies/abzealcoreThumb.png)

**Website:** [http://www.zealcore.com/products.html](http://www.zealcore.com/products.html)

The ZealCore System Debugger collects and refines information contained in logs. This is achieved by advanced post processing of log information, by fusion of different logs, by mapping recorded information to high level models, and, not the least, by bringing order to the log exploration and debugging process. The System Debugger can be used during development, integration, test, deployment, and operation depending on when the logs have been gathered. The ZealCore System Debugger lets you create projects and logsets for tracking down bugs in software. A logset can cover information from several logs, and a project can manage several logsets, either from one and the same system collected at different occasions, from different software versions or e.g., from different nodes in a distributed system. Moreover, the ZealCore System Debugger allows you to make advanced post processing of data including filtering and advanced searches that can pinpoint a specific behavior. The search results are synchronized with other views and exploring the results is just a click away. Assertions allow for automatic fault identification, risks and negative trends. The latter is especially powerful when the post processing is performed on e.g., logs from different versions of software for a system � making it possible to detect subtle behavioral differences between the software versions which later could lead to system failures or poor performance.
