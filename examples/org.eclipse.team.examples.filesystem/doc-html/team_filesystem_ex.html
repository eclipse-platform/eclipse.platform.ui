<h2>Team - File System Repository Provider Example</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
The File System Repository Provider shows how to define your own repository provider.
It shows how to override the RepositoryProvider class and register this new class as 
a repository provider using the Team extension point. It also illustrates how to create
and register a configuration wizard for connecting a local project to a remote location
and how to provide some custom Team and Replace with menu items for simple Get and Put operations. In 
addition it also shows how to use the validate save/validate edit mechanism to support
pessimistic providers.


<h3>Running the example</h3>

To start using this example create a project and select Team > Share Project... from the
project's popup menu. In the wizrd that opens, select File System Example and click Next.
Now enter the location in the local file system where you would like to connect the project
to. The Get and Put operations in the Team menu will now transfer to and from the selected 
location.
