 * An Intro standby part. It is a UI component that represents some standby
 * content. Standby parts can be contributed to the Eclipse intro using the
 * following extension point:
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 *         &lt;extension point=&quot;org.eclipse.ui.intro.configExtension&quot;&gt;
 *        	&lt;standbyPart

 *       		class=&quot;com.x.y.someClass&quot;
 *       		id=&quot;com.x.y.someContentPartId&quot;&gt;
 *       	&lt;/standbyPart&gt; 
 *         &lt;/extension&gt;
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </p>
 * Standby content parts have a life cycle that starts with a call to init,
 * shortly after part construction, followed by a call to createPartControl.
 * During these two calls, the part is responsible for creating its content and
 * using the memento to try to recreate its previous state. SetInput is the last
 * method called when trying to create a standby part.
 * 
 * @since 3.0
