/**
 * A content provider for dynamic intro content. It is initialized with the
 * content provider site because a typical content provider would need to update
 * its contents dynamically at runtime. And so, the site can be informed of a
 * need to redraw its content through a call to its reflow(..) method.
 * <p>
 * The life cycle of an IIntroContentProvider is as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>a content provider is defined in the Intro content markup file (ie:
 * introContent.xml file) as follows:
 * 
 * <p>
 * &lt;contentProvider id=&quot;roles&quot;
 * class=&quot;x.y.z.ContentProvider&quot;&gt; <br>
 * &lt;text&gt;Some alternate text for dynamic content&lt;/text&gt; <br>
 * &lt;/contentProvider&gt;
 * </p>
 * 
 * This defines the content provider as part of the intro content for that page.
 * </li>
 * <li>the content provider class is created when the page that contains this
 * provider is loaded. It is only created once in the life cycle of an open
 * Intro view, ie: the class instance is cached and only disposed of when the
 * intro view is closed.
 * <li>init() is called to initialize the instance of the class on load of the
 * page. This is where the provider site can be cached for later reuse.</li>
 * <li>createContent() is then called to give the content provider a chance to
 * generate the dynamic content. This is when the dynamic content can be cached
 * for later reuse when the same page is shown again.</li>
 * <li>it is important to note that there is a difference between when the
 * createContent() is called in the case of SWT and HTML presentations. The HTML
 * presentation is dynamic html generated on the fly each time an Intro page
 * needs to be displayed. SWT presentation on the other hand, is based on SWT
 * forms widgets, and for performance, each page is only created once and cached
 * in a pageBook for re-use. With this in mind, createContent() is called every
 * time a page is shown in the case of HTML presentation. Whereas it is only
 * called once in the case of the SWT presentation. This is why createContent()
 * should not be used as a means of refreshing content. Content should only be
 * created once during this method call, and cached for later re-use. If a
 * refresh is needed, then reflow() should be called on the contentProviderSite
 * when the appropriate event happens.
 * <li>finally, when the intro view is closed, dispose will be called on the
 * content provider to give it a chance to dispose of any resources.</li>
