Provides interfaces that need to be implemented by web browser adapters.

<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
Base Help System, requires web browser to display help document.&nbsp; Since
availability of web browsers differ from system to system, it is possible
to configure browser adapters in addition to ones provided with the base.&nbsp;
The browser (or browser adapter) can be configured by
providing extension for <tt>org.eclipse.help.base.browser</tt> extension point.&nbsp;
If more than one browser is available on a user system, the default browser
can be designated in Help preference page.
<p>In general terms, implementing a web browser involves:
<ul>
<li>
Implementing standalone UI element having the <tt>IBrowser</tt> API, and
capable of displaying HTML documents given a URL.</li>

<li>
Providing a factory for managing of browsers on a particular system, by
implementing <tt>IBrowserFactory</tt> interface.</li>

<li>
Declaring an extension of the <tt>org.eclipse.help.base.browser</tt> extension
point that mentions the name of that factory class.</li>
</ul>
Note that browser factory will be created on every system.&nbsp; If the
factory is not capable of creating a browser on some system configurations,
due to missing prerequisites e.t.c., its <tt>isAvailable()</tt> method
should be returning false on these systems.
