/**
 * Participant in the help search. A plug-in can contribute instance of SearchParticipant to
 * <code>"org.eclipse.help.search.searchParticipant"</code> extension point. Search
 * participant is responsible for adding the content of documents it is responsible for into the
 * help system's search index. Once in the index, the document becomes searchable and can produce
 * search hits. There are two ways of using the participant:
 * <ol>
 * <li> For adding documents that are part of the help's TOC that have content formats not known to
 * the default indexer (which are essentially all documents that are not of HTML format). In this
 * case, the help system knows about the documents because they are in TOC but does not know how to
 * index them. Because of the non-HTML format, help search participants are normally accompanied by
 * the help content producers that are responsible for transforming the unknown format into HTML on
 * the fly. <br>
 * <br>
 * When used in this mode, search participants must be registered with file extensions they handle.
 * Based on the file extension mapping, they will be the first to get a chance at indexing the
 * document with the matching extension.<br>
 * <br>
 * </li>
 * <li> For adding documents that are outside of the help's TOC. In this case, the documents are
 * completely unknown to the help system. Search participants are responsible for providing a set of
 * documents they know about and are not supposed to declare file extensions they can handle. They
 * are also responsible for opening these documents when asked because the help system will not be
 * able to open them in any meaningful way. </li>
 * </ol>
