# Contributing to Eclipse Platform

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

Eclipse Platform defines the set of frameworks and common services that
collectively make up infrastructure required to support the use of Eclipse as a
component model, as a Rich Client Platform (RCP) and as a comprehensive tool
integration platform. These services and frameworks include a standard workbench
user interface model and portable native widget toolkit, a project model for
managing resources, automatic resource delta management for incremental
compilers and builders, language-independent debug infrastructure, and
infrastructure for distributed multi-user versioned resource management.
