 * Base class for adding controls to cheat sheet items.

 * Subclasses are used in conjunction with the
 * <code>org.eclipse.ui.cheatsheets.cheatSheetItemExtension</code> extension
 * point. Subclasses must be public and have a public 1-arg constructor 
 * that takes the name of the attribute type <code>String</code>. The
 * extension point specifies the name of the subclass and the name of the XML
 * attribute that it can handle. When the cheat sheet framework encounters an
 * item (or subitem) element in the cheat sheet content file with an attribute
 * with a matching name, an instance of the corresponding item extension subclass
 * is created. It is up to this instance to remember the attribute value if
 * required. Later, when creating the visual controls for the item
 * are being created, the instance is given the opportunity to add extra controls.
