/**
 * Manages the running of a cheat sheet.
 * <p>
 * Each cheat sheet that is opened in the UI is assigned its own cheat sheet
 * manager, which stays with it until the cheat sheet is completed (or
 * restarted). The cheat sheet manager is passed as a parameter to cheat
 * sheet-aware actions which implement {@link ICheatSheetAction}. The manager
 * carries arbitrary key-value data (strings) for the lifetime of a cheat sheet,
 * and can be accessed via {@link #getData(String)}and
 * {@link #setData(String, String)}. If the workbench is shut down while the
 * cheat sheet is in progress, this data will generally be saved and later
 * restored when the workbench is restarted and cheat sheet is resumed. The
 * manager also supports a {@link CheatSheetListener}(specified via the
 * "listener" attribute of the "cheatsheet" element in the cheat sheet content
 * file), which is kept informed of life cycle events over the course of the
 * cheat sheet's life time.
