/**
 * Handles a command for a debugger. Specific command handlers extend this interface.
 * <p>
 * The debug platform provides actions for common debug commands that operate against
 * these handler interfaces. For example, the platform provides a terminate action that
 * operates on the active debug context (selected element in the debug view). The action
 * delegates to the active context's {@link ITerminateHandler} implementation to update
 * its enabled state and execute the command. Debug model elements may implement supported
 * command handler interfaces directly or provide them as adapters. The debug platform
 * provides implementations of handlers for standard debug models.
