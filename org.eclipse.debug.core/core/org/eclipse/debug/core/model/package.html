<h3>The Debug Model</h3>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> this package is part of an interim API that is still under
development and expected to change significantly before reaching stability. It is being
made available at this early stage to soloicit feedback from pioneering adopters on the
understanding that any code that uses this API will almost certainly be broken
(repeatedly) as the API evolves.</p>

<p>A language independent &quot;debug model&quot; is represented by the set of interfaces
defined in <font face="Courier">org.eclipse.debug.core.model</font>. A client implements a debug
model by providing an implementation of these interfaces in a plug-in. (There is no
explicit extension point that represents a debug model). Each debug architecture will have
its own way of initiating a debug session. Generally, each debug model will provide one or
more launchers capable of initiating a debug session. A &quot;launcher&quot; is an
extension point defined by the debug plug-in. A launcher is responsible for starting a
debug session, and registering the result with the debug plug-in. Launching is a client
responsibility.</p>

<p>The common elements defined by the debug plug-in are: 

<ul>
  <li>Debug Target - a debug target represents a debuggable program - for example, a virtual
    machine or a process.</li>
  <li>Thread - a debug target may contain one or more threads</li>
  <li>Stack Frame - a thread that is suspended may contain one or more stack frames</li>
  <li>Variable - a stack frame may contain variables</li>
  <li>Value - each variable has a value, and a value may contain more variables (to represent
    complex data structures and objects)</li>
  <li>Process - a program running in normal (non-debug) mode</li>
</ul>

<h4>Rendering &amp; Presentation</h4>

<p>Debug model elements and breakpoints are displayed in the workbench. To support
configurable and extensible presentation, the debug UI plug-in defines the <font
face="Courier">debugModelPresentations</font> extension point. Extensions of this kind
register for a specific debug model. It is intended that an implementation of a debug
model will also provide an implementation of a debug model presentation. The presentation
provides: 

<ul>
  <li>an image for a debug element or breakpoint</li>
  <li>a label for a debug element or breakpoint</li>
  <li>an editor input that should be used to display the debug element or breakpoint</li>
</ul>
