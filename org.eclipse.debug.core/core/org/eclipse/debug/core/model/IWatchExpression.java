/**
 * A watch expression is an expression that is evaluated in the context
 * of a specific stack frame, thread, debug target, process, or launch.
 * Generally, a watch expression is a snippet of code that is evaluated
 * each time a debug target suspends, or when a user provides a context
 * for an evaluation by selecting a debug target or thread. An expression
 * updates its value when it is provided with a context in which it
 * can perform an evaluation. 
 * <p>
 * An implementation is provided by the debug platform. Clients that support watch expressions
 * should contribute and implement a watch expression delegate. Watch
 * expressions can be created via the <code>IExpressionManager</code>.
 * </p>
 * @see org.eclipse.debug.core.model.IWatchExpressionDelegate
