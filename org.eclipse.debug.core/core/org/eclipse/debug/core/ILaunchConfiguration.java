/**
 * A launch configuration describes how to launch an application.
 * Each launch configuration is an instance of a type of launch
 * configuration as described by a launch configuration type 
 * extension. Each launch configuration has a launch configuration
 * delegate which performs the actual launching of a
 * configuration.
 * <p>
 * A launch configuration may be shared in a repository via
 * standard VCM mechanisms, or may be stored locally, essentially
 * making the launch configuration private for a single user.
 * Thus, a launch configuration may stored as a file in the
 * workspace (shared), or as a file in the debug plug-in's state
 * location.
 * </p>
 * A launch configuration is a handle to its underlying storage.
 * Methods annotated as "handle-only" do not require a configuration
 * to exist. Methods that require an underlying configuration to exist
 * throw a <code>CoreException</code> when an underlying configuration
 * is missing.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A launch configuration is modified by obtaining a working copy
 * of a launch configuration, modifying the working copy, and then
 * saving the working copy.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Clients that define a launch configuration delegate extension implement the
 * <code>ILaunchConfigurationDelegate</code> interface.
 * </p>
 * @see ILaunchConfigurationType
 * @see org.eclipse.debug.core.model.ILaunchConfigurationDelegate
 * @see ILaunchConfigurationWorkingCopy
 * @since 2.0
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
