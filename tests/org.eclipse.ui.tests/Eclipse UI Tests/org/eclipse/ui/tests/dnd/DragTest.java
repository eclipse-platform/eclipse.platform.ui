/**
 * Tests a single drag-drop scenario, given a dragSource capable of initiating the drag and
 * a dropTarget that can locate the drop location. DragTestSuite will create a large number
 * of DragTests by matching combinations of drag sources with drop targets.
 * <p>
 * <b>TEST NAMES:</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The name of the test indicates what drag scenario was being attempted. For example, the
 * test "drag Navigator to right of editor area" drags the Navigator view over
 * the editor area, dropping it near the right edge. Drag sources are described as follows:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * [maximized] viewname [folder]
 * </p>
 * <p>Drag sources prefixed by "maximized" were maximized at the time the drag started.
 * The word [folder] indicates that folder containing the given editor or view was being dragged.
 * Otherwise, the view itself was being dragged.</p>
 * <p>Drop targets are described as follows:</p>
 * <p>
 * [left|right|top|bottom|center] of targetname
 * </p>
 * <p>Drop targets are always on top of the target. That is, "right of Navigator" means "on top of
 * the navigator view near its right edge" -- NOT "to the right of the Navigator view". When the
 * drop target is on an edge, it is always located 1 pixel away from the middle of that edge.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>WHAT TO DO IF THIS TEST FAILS:</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If a drag operation did not have the intended effect, the test will fail with
 * a result like:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Expecting 'layout ((((*Navigator)-active (*Problems))|layout ((Mock Editor 1, *Mock Editor 2)|active_nofocus (*Mock Editor 2)))-(*Outline, Properties))' and found 'layout ((layout ((Mock Editor 1, *Mock Editor 2)|active_nofocus (*Mock Editor 2))-(*Outline, Problems, Properties))-active (*Navigator))'
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The expected and actual results are ASCII pictures of the layout. A stack of views or editors
 * is shown as a list enclosed in brackets, with an asterisk indicating the selected pane. The stack
 * may be prefixed by the words "active" or "active_nofocus" if they currently have the active or
 * active_nofocus appearance. Inactive stacks have no prefix.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, (Problems, *Console, Properties) indicates a stack containing the Problems, Console, and Properties views,
 * where the Console view was currently selected. The root layout and editor areas are shown as "layout (...)". A vertical sash is shown as a
 * bar "|" and a horizontal sash is shown using a dash "-".  All drag tests are done in the Drag Test
 * Perspective.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The initial layout is:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * layout (((*Navigator)|layout ((Mock Editor 1, *Mock Editor 2)|active (*Mock Editor 2)))-(*Outline, Problems, Properties))
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Where editor 0 is "Mock Editor 1", and editors 1 and 2 are shown as "Mock Editor 2".
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you see a message like "dragtests.xml is out of date", this indicates that new tests
 * were added without describing their intended behavior in dragtests.xml. In that case, ensure that
 * there are currently no failures and regenerate dragtests.xml as described below.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>WHAT TO DO IF THE INTENTED BEHAVIOR CHANGES:</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If new tests are added or the existing drag/drop behavior is changed, it will
 * be necessary to update dragtests.xml. Do this as follows:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>include org.eclipse.ui.tests with your other plugins and launch an inner workspace</li>
 * <li>Go to customize perspective... -&gt; commands -&gt; Drag Test. This will add the "Drag-Drop Snapshot" item to your menubar.</li>
 * <li>Select "Drag-Drop Snapshot"</li>
 * <li>Select a file where the new shapshot will be saved, and click Okay</li>
 * <li>DO NOT use the mouse while generating dragtests.xml. This
 *     can interfere with the tests and cause an incorrect behavior to be recorded as the expected behavior.
 *     In particular, focus changes should be avoided.</li>
 * <li>Wait for several minutes while the test runs</li>
 * <li>When the test is complete, copy the file over the old data/dragtests.xml file</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * At this point, the current drag/drop behavior will be considered the correct behavior,
 * and deviations will cause the test suites to fail.
 * </p>

 * @since 3.0
