 * This class is used as test entries for 'Detached Window' tests (i.e. where the drop target is

 * two 'mock' views and separately detaching an individual view, making them appropriate drop targets
 * for these tests.
 * <p>
 * In some cases the sources and targets may overlap with non-detached tests so in order to avoid
 * name clashes in the tests we add a suffix, "(Detached)", to the test's 'name' when the target is
 * 'Detached'.
