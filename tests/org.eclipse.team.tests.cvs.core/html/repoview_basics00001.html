<h3>Adding and Discarding Locations</h3>

<p>You should be able to create a repository location from the toolbar of the view or via the context menu. 
Try expanding the location, the HEAD, Versions and Branches categories. Also, 
try the failures cases from <a href="connections00001.html">Connections</a>.
Things to try:
<ul>
<li>Create repo locations for different connection types: ext, pserver, extssh.
<li>Expanding project nodes should process the children in the background and the 
view should remain responsive while this is happening. When children nodes are added to the 
tree the tree shouldn't be too jumpy.
<li>Discard a location and ensure it is removed. Also ensure that discarding is not permitted when 
projects in the local workspace are shared with the location.
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Repository Location Properties</h3>

View a location's properties page and ensure that information is correct and can be changed. 
Ensure that the sharing information for any projects mapped to the location are also changed.

<h3>Modules</h3>

<h3>Working with modules</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Expanding HEAD or the Versions category should display the modules defined in the CVSROOT/modules file</li>
  <li>Check Out and Checkout As should be availabel on modules and should work as expected</li>
  <li>Performing a "Configure Branches and Versions" on the module allows the user to set the autorefresh file and add some tags.
  Ensure that the module now appears properly in association with those tags.</li>
</ol>
