There are many standard decorations in the sync view. Most significant are the propagated flags.

<h3>Conflicts</h3>
<p>
Conflicting changes should be propagated to parent resources such that you can easily see, when the tree
is collapsed that there are conflicts. When the conflict is resolved, the parent conflict markers should be
removed.
</p>
<h3>Error and Warning problem markers</h3>
<p>
Error and warning makers are shown on resources and propagated to parent resources such that you can
easily see if you are releasing errors or warnings.
</p>
<h3>Branch changes</h3>
<p>
Changes to branches, revisions, should be updated automatically in the views decorators. For example, if you branch 
from the sync view the branch name should appear.
