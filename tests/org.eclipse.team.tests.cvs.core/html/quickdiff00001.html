<p>Enable CVS quick diff for text and java files via the General > Editors > Quick Diff preference. Then try the following
scenarios:</p>

<ol>

marking the changes. Next, run Replace With > Latest from HEAD. The annotations are
removed and the file is clean.

<li>Same as 1 but this time instead commit the file. The quickdiff annotations
are removed and the file is clean.

changes to file1 in project1 and commit the change. Synchronize project2 and
