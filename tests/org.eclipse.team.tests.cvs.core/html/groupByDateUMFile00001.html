<p><b>Purpose:</b> Test the group by date mechanism for both local history and CVS history.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the History view.</li>
  <li>Roll back your system clock 1 day, make a change to your local unmapped file and save it.</li>
  <li>Roll back your system clock to the beginning of the month and make some changes to the local unmapped file and save it.</li>
  <li>Roll back your system clock to anywhere before the beginning of the current month, make a change to the local unmapped file and save it.</li>
  <li>Reset your clock to the current date and show the file's history (DND or [Team>Show Local History]/[Team>Show History] for local and CVS files respectively).</li>
  <li>Verify that the revisions appear in the appropriate categories: Today, Yesterday, This Month and Previous.</li>
  <li>Click the Group by Revisions Date button and make sure that the categories toggle on and off.</li>
</ol>

<p>The above should be tested with history from both an unmanaged file and a CVS file.</p>
