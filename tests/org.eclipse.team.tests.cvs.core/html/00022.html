<h3>Scenario 1: One Time Merge</h3>

<p>
Using Team>Merge, merge the changes from a branch into HEAD. Once completed, in the synchronize view, 
update the incoming changes, resolve any conflicts and ensure they worked, After updating, 
redo the same merge. A no-changes dialog should be 
presented since the local contents match the end-point.

<p>
Things to try:
<ul>
<li>Use content assist to select an existing branch for the end tag. A root versions should be automatically found if it exists.
<li>Choose to perform the merge into the local workspace. Ensure it works with and without a start tag.
</ul>

<h3>Scenario 2: Ongoing Merge</h3>

After performing a one-time merge, pin the entry in the synchronize view. 
Release changes to the end point (branch) and synchronize the merge.
The new changes should appear in the synchronize view. Update to these
changes as appropriate.

<h3>Scenario 3: Direct Merge</h3>

Perform a Team>Merge and choose to merge directly into the workspace. Try both the
case with a base tag and without it.
 
<h3>Removing a Merge</h3>

<p>Delete the merge from the synchronize view using the remove toolbar button. The merge subscriber should be removed from the view.
