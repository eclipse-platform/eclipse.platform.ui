There are a couple of preferences that controls the behavior and presentation of the console. 
To enable this testing, you must first enable font and label decorations. This can be done
by going to <i>Window/Preferences/Team/CVS/Label Decorations</i> and checking off <b>"Enable font
and color decorations"</b>.
<p>
These are:
<ul>
<li>font: changing the font should immediately update the sync view as well as all other views decorated by CVS (ie. Package Explorer).
<li>font color: message color, error color, command line. Changing these should immediately update the console view.
</ul>
