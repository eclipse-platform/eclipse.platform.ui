<p><b>Purpose:</b> Test the functionality of the various buttons common to both the Local File History page and the CVS History page</p>

Note: Even though the functionality is the same for both pages, the tests should be conducted on both an unmanaged file and a CVS file as each history page has its own respective implementation for the following actions.
