<p>This scenario captures one means of patching. It assumes that a zip file contains 
a previous version of a project that has been modified in some way and added to
a zip archive (without CVS directories).</p>

<p>Perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Load the project from CVS (using Checkout or some other means)</li>
  <li>Import the zip over the loaded project.</li>
  <li>Ensure that the sync states are Outgoing for all resources from the zip file.</li>
  <li>Ensure that all folders from the zip file (except new ones)
  are marked as in-sync and all files (except new ones) are outgoing changes.
  <li>Changing the comparison criteria to compare contents should not contact the server
  and should leave only the resources that differ in the sync view. Perform a 
  Mark As Merged and a Commit on these resources.</li>
  <li>Changing the comparison criteria back to revision number will reveal all the files
  whose content did not change, perform a Mark as merged on these resources followed by 
  a Team>Update on the project in the Navigator (Note: This could be handled better).</li>
  <li>After the update, ensure the project has no out-of-sync resources.</li>
</ol>
