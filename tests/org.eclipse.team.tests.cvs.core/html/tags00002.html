Tag lists appear in many dialogs:
<ul>
<li>Replace with Branch or Version
<li>Compare with Branch or Version
<li>Share of existing project
<li>Switch to Another Branch or Versions
<li>Tag with Existing
<li>Tag as Version
</ul>

<p>
In each of these places, typing in the tag text field will filter the list of shown tags. 
The option to Refresh and Configure tags should also be present. Refreshing behavior should be as follows:

<ol>
	<li>If an auto-refresh file (.project by default) exists and has tags, the tags are obtained from the file.
	<li>If there is no auto-refresh file, the log command is used to determine if there are any tags in the files
	that are direct children of the remote folder.
	<li>If no tags are found, the user is prompted to either perform a deep log to find any tags or configure the
	tags manually.
</ol>
