<h3>Compare a resource with other resource</h3>
<h5>The action</h5>
<ul>
<li>The action should appear only when there are 2 or 3 resources selected.</li>
<li>If there are 3 resources selected you should be prompted to select the common ancestor.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Look</h5>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that all titles and labels are ok (e.g. dialog title, structure pane title, compare editor labels...).</li>
<li>Ensure that all buttons in the toolbar are properly enabled (e.g. Copy All/Copy Current, Next/Prev Difference/Change).</li>
<li>Ensure that difference markers are properly display at start</li>
</ul>
<h5>Navigation</h5>
<ul>
<li>If you reach the first/last difference you should be prompted to go to the end/start of the current element.</li>
<li>Ensure that you can correctly navigate through differences using the difference markers on the right side of the editor.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Merging</h5>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that Copy All/Copy Current actions work as expected.</li>
<li>Ensure that when the Copy All action is used all difference markers disappear.</li>
<li>Ensure that when the Copy Current action is used a proper difference marker disappears.</li>
<li>Ensure you can Undo an action.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Saving</h5>
<ul>
<li>If you edit a local resource the dirty state indicator should appear over the resource.</li>
<li>If you edit a local resource and the resource is also opened in a different editor the dirty state should appear on that editor too.</li>
<li>If you edit both of the resources being compare (both are local), changes should be saved to both of them.</li> 
<li>If you edit a resource and close the editor you should be prompted to save or abandon changes.</li>
<li>If you edit both of the resources and close the editor you should be prompted to select which resources to save using the Save Resources dialog.</li>
<li>Ensure you can Undo a change.</li>
<li>Ensure that changes are saved correctly to the underlying resource.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Concurrent edition</h5>
<ul>
<li>Scenario 1
<ol>
<li>Compare two local resources using the Compare Editor.</li>
<li>Open one of them in the default editor (F3) and edit it.</li>
<li>Ensure that the resource gets the dirty state indicator over both editors (i.e default and Compare).</li>
<li>If you save the resource in the default editor the dirty state indicator should go off for both editors.</li>
<li>Ensure that changes are saved correctly to the underlying resource.</li> 
</ol>
</li>
<li>Scenario 2a
<ol>
<li>Compare two local resources using the Compare Editor.</li>
<li>Open one of them in the default editor (F3) and edit it.</li>

<li>If you close the default editor you should be prompted to save changes, exiting without saving or cancel.</li>
<li>Select exit without saving (button named "No").</li>
<li>Ensure that the resource under the Compare Editor is still in the dirty state.</li>
<li>Ensure that changes are the same as made using the default editor.</li>
<li>Ensure that changes can be saved to the underlying resource from the Compare Editor.</li>
<li>Ensure that changes are saved correctly to the underlying resource.</li>
