/**
 * Workspace session tests function as follows:  Each test class looks like a typical JUnit test,
 * except the platform is shutdown and restarted after each test method.  The steps for each
 * test method are:
 *  - startup the platform
 *  - run setUp
 *  - run the test method
 *  - run tearDown
 *  - shutdown the platform
 * 
 * Tests are run according to the natural order of their method names.  This is the
 * partial ordering defined by the String.compareTo() operation.  Each test method
 * must begin with the prefix "test", and have no parameters (thus overloading is
 * not supported).
 * 
 * After all test methods in the class have been run, the platform location is deleted.
 * This way, each test class plays like a series of related operations on the same
 * workspace, with each operation running in a separate platform instance.
 *
