 * Callback interface for clients interested in being notified when jobs change state.
 * <p>
 * A single job listener instance can be added either to the job manager, for notification
 * of all scheduled jobs, or to any set of individual jobs.  A single listener instance should
 * not be added to both the job manager, and to individual jobs (such a listener may
 * receive duplicate notifications).
 * </p><p>
 * Clients should not rely on the result of the <code>Job#getState()</code>
 * method on jobs for which notification is occurring. Listeners are notified of
 * all job state changes, but whether the state change occurs before, during, or
 * after listeners are notified is unspecified.
 * </p><p>
 * Clients may implement this interface.
