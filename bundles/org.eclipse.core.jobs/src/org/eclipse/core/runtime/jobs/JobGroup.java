/**
 * JobGroups support throttling, join, cancel, combined progress and error reporting
 * on a group of jobs.
 * <ul>
 * <li>A JobGroup object represents a group of Jobs. Any number of jobs
 * can be added to a group, but a Job can be part of only one group at a time.
 * <li>A JobGroup can be configured with a throttling number, so that only that many
 * jobs from the group are allowed to run in parallel.
 * <li>One can join on all of the jobs in the group and observe the completion progress
 * of those jobs.
 * <li>One can cancel all the jobs in the group.
 * <li>A JobGroup consolidates the return statuses of all the jobs in the group
 * and a single MultiStatus message is available after all the jobs in the group
 * are completed.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * JobGroups maintain state for the collective status of the jobs belonging to the group.
 * When constructed, a job group starts with a state value of <code>NONE</code>.
 * When any job belonging to the group is scheduled to run, the job group moves into the
 * <code>ACTIVE</code> state. A job group enters the <code>CANCELING</code> state
 * when cancellation of the whole group is requested. The group will be in this state
 * until all the jobs in the group have finished either through cancellation or
 * normal completion. When a job group is in the <code>CANCELING</code> state,
 * newly scheduled jobs which are part of that group are immediately canceled.
 * When execution of all the jobs belonging to a job group finishes (either normally
 * or through cancellation), the job group state changes back to <code>NONE</code>.
 *
 * @see IJobManager
 * @since 3.7
