/**
 * A synchronize participant is a visual component that can be displayed within any
 * control (e.g. view, editor, dialog).  Typically a participant is used to show changes between 
 * local resources and variant states of those resources and allows the user to perform actions
 * to manipulate the changes. 
 * <p>
 * This class does not mandate how the synchronization state is displayed, but instead provides
 * the accessors that clients would use to create a visual instance of the this participant.
 * </p><p>
 * A participant can display multiple instances of its synchronization state to the user via the creation 
 * of a page {@link #createPage(ISynchronizePageConfiguration)} and
 * clients can decide where to display the page. For example, the synchronize view is an example
 * of a client that displays a participant in a view. However, you can imagine that a client may
 * also want to display this state in a wizard or dialog instead. 
 * </p><p>
 * When a participant is registered with the {@link ISynchronizeManager} it will automatically display 
 * in the <i>Synchronize View</i> and if the participant extension point
 * enabled <code>synchronizeWizards</code> it will also appear in the global synchronize action
 * toolbar. 
 * <p>
 * A participant is added to the workbench as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A <code>synchronizeParticipant</code> extension is contributed to 
 * the team registry. This extension defines the participant id, name, icon, type, and 
 * participant class.
 * <li>A user via a wizard provided by the <code>synchronizeWizards</code> extension point
 * or client code, creates a participant instance and registers it with the
 * synchronize manager. It then appears in the synchronize view.
 * <li>A synchronization can be persistent and thus re-initialized at startup. 
 * <li>A pinned participant will only be removed from the synchronize manager if it is un-pinned.
 * </ul></p>
 * <p>
 * Once a participant is added to the synchronize manager its lifecycle will be managed. On shutdown if
 * the participant is persistable, the participant will be asked to persist state via 
 * the <code>saveState()</code> method. At startup the <code>init()</code> method is called
 * with a handle to the state that was saved. The dispose method is called when the participant is
 * removed from the manager and at shutdown.
 * </p>
