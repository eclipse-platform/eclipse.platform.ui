Application programming interfaces for displaying synchronization
states and variants.</p>
<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>This package contains classes that support displaying
synchronization information described by SyncInfo. If you consider the
synchronization model described by the classes in
org.eclipse.team.core.synchronize as the physical representation of
resource variants then the classes in this package allow you to control
how the model is presented to the user. One key feature of these APIs
is that they support managing dynamic models.<br>
</p>
<p>There is no specific support for the Synchronize View in this
package. Instead, the classes here can be used to build a page that can
be shown in the view, but they can also be used to show synchronization
information in dialogs, wizards, and editors.<br>
</p>
<p>The central abstractions for presenting synchronization state are:<br>
</p>
<p>- SynchronizeModelProvider, SynchronizeModelElement: are the
building blocks for
describing the logical structure of a synchronization model.<br>
- StructuredViewerAdvisor: are used to
display the logical structure to the user and define the basics such as
the SynchronizeModelProvider, label provider, and context menus.<br>
- SyncInfoCompareInput: is used to show a comparison between a local
resource and a variant in a compare editor.<br>
- SyncInfoSetCompareInput: is used to showing a set of variants in a
compare editor<br>
</p>
<p>Default implementations are provided and there are many levels of
customizations available.<br>
</p>
<h2>Basic Example</h2>
If you have a synchronization model described in a SyncInfoTree and
would like to show it to the user in a simple resource hierarchical
tree viewers you would:<br>
<br>
SyncInfoTree syncTree = getSyncTree();<br>
DiffTreeViewerConfiguration viewerConfiguration = new
DiffTreeViewerConfiguration(syncTree);<br>
TreeViewer viewer = new TreeViewer(parent);<br>
viewerConfiguration.initializeViewer(viewer);<br>
...<br>
viewerConfiguration.dispose();<br>
<br>
Some items of interest in the above example: (1) the viewer
configuration is used to add behavior to different types of tree
viewers and by default will build a hierarchical logical model of the
synchronization info and, (2) the default label provider will show the
nodes with resource decorations plus the standard diff change markers,
(3) the default context menu action is expand all plus any object
contributions.<br>
<br>
Another example, you would like to add additional label decorations,
and actions defined as viewerContribution in your plugin.xml.<br>
<br>
SyncInfoTree syncTree = getSyncTree();<br>
DiffTreeViewerConfiguration viewerConfiguration = new
DiffTreeViewerConfiguration("org.eclipse.team.example.actions",
syncTree) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; protected ILabelProvider getLabelProvider() {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return new
SyncInfoLabelProvider.DecoratingColorLabelProvider(new
SyncInfoLabelProvider(), new MyCustorDecorator());<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br>
}<br>
TreeViewer viewer = new TreeViewer(parent);<br>
viewerConfiguration.initializeViewer(viewer);<br>
...<br>
viewerConfiguration.dispose();<br>
