/**
 * Allows a model provider to build a view of their model that includes
 * synchronization information with a remote location (usually a repository).
 * <p>
 * The scope of the context is defined when the context is created. The creator
 * of the scope may affect changes on the scope which will result in property
 * change events from the scope and may result in change events from the diff
 * tree. Clients should note that it is possible that a change in the scope will
 * result in new resources with differences being covered by the scope but not
 * result in a change event from the diff tree. This can occur because the set
 * may already have contained a diff for the resource with the understanding
 * that the client would have ignored it. Consequently, clients should listen to
 * both sources in order to guarantee that they update any dependent state
 * appropriately.
 * <p>
 * <a name="async">The diff tree associated with this context may be updated
 * asynchronously in response to calls to any method of this context (e.g.
 * refresh methods) that may result in changes in the synchronization state of
 * resources. It may also get updated as a result of changes triggered from
 * other sources. Hence, the callback from the diff tree to report changes may
 * occur in the same thread as the method call or asynchronously in a separate
 * thread, regardless of who triggered the refresh. Clients of this method (and
 * any other asynchronous method on this context) may determine if all changes
 * have been collected using {@link IJobManager#find(Object)} using this context
 * as the <code>family</code> argument in order to determine if there are any
 * jobs running that are populating the diff tree. Clients may also call
 * {@link IJobManager#join(Object, IProgressMonitor)} if they wish to wait until
 * all background handlers related to this context are finished.
 * </p>

 * @see SynchronizationContext
 * @see MergeContext

 * @since 3.2
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 *              They should subclass {@link SynchronizationContext} or one of
 *              its subclasses instead.
