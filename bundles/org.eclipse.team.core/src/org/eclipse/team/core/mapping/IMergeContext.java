	/**
	 * Method that can be called by the model merger to attempt a file-system
	 * level merge. This is useful for cases where the model merger does not
	 * need to do any special processing to perform the merge. By default, this
	 * method attempts to use an appropriate {@link IStorageMerger} to merge the
	 * files covered by the provided traversals. If a storage merger cannot be
	 * found, the text merger is used. If this behavior is not desired,
	 * sub-classes of {@link MergeContext} may override this method.
	 * <p>
	 * This method does a best-effort attempt to merge of the file associated
	 * with the given diff. A file that could not be merged will be indicated in
	 * the returned status. If the status returned has the code
	 * <code>MergeStatus.CONFLICTS</code>, the list of failed files can be
	 * obtained by calling the <code>MergeStatus#getConflictingFiles()</code>
	 * method.
	 * <p>
	 * It is not expected that clients of this API will associate special
	 * meaning with the existence of a folder other than the fact that it
	 * contains files. The sync delta tree should still include folder changes
	 * so that clients that have a one-to-one correspondence between their model
	 * objects and folders can decorate these elements appropriately. However,
	 * clients of this API will only be expected to perform operations on file
	 * deltas and will expect folders to be created as needed to contain the
	 * files (i.e. implementations of this method should ignore any folder
	 * deltas in the provided deltas). Clients will also expect local folders
	 * that have incoming folder deletions to be removed once all the folder's
	 * children have been removed using merge.
	 * <p>
	 * There are two special cases where merge is meaningful for folders. First,
	 * a merge on a local added empty folder with force set should delete the
	 * folder. However, the folder should not be deleted if it has any local
	 * children unless merge is called for those resources first and they end up
	 * being deleted as a result. Second, a merge on an incoming folder addition
	 * should create the empty folder locally.
	 * <p>
	 * It is not expected that clients of this API will be capable of dealing
	 * with namespace conflicts. Implementors should ensure that any namespace
	 * conflicts are dealt with before the merger is invoked.
	 * <p>
	 * The deltas provided to this method should be those obtained from the tree ({@link ISynchronizationContext#getDiffTree()})
	 * of this context. Any resource changes triggered by this merge will be
	 * reported through the resource delta mechanism and the change notification
	 * mechanisms of the delta tree associated with this context.
	 * <p>
	 * For two-way merging, as indicated by either the
	 * {@link ISynchronizationContext#getType()} or {@link #getMergeType()}
	 * methods, clients can either accept changes using the
	 * {@link #merge(IDiff[], boolean, IProgressMonitor) } method or reject them
	 * using {@link #markAsMerged(IDiff, boolean, IProgressMonitor) }.
	 * Three-way changes are a bit more complicated. The following list
	 * summarizes how particular remote file changes can be handled. The delta
	 * kind and flags mentioned in the descriptions are obtained the remote
	 * change (see {@link IThreeWayDiff#getRemoteChange()}), whereas conflicts
	 * are indicated by the three-way delta itself.
	 * <ul>
	 * 
	 * <li> When the delta kind is {@link IDiff#ADD} and the delta is also a
	 * move (i.e. the {@link ITwoWayDiff#MOVE_FROM} is set). The merge can
	 * either use the {@link #merge(IDiff[], boolean, IProgressMonitor) } method
	 * to accept the rename or perform an
	 * {@link IFile#move(IPath, boolean, boolean, IProgressMonitor) } where the
	 * source file is obtained using {@link ITwoWayDiff#getFromPath()} and the
	 * destination is the path of the delta ({@link IDiff#getPath()}). This
	 * later approach is helpful in the case where the local file and remote
	 * file both contain content changes (i.e. the file can be moved by the
	 * model and then the contents can be merged by the model). </li>
	 * 
	 * <li> When the delta kind is {@link IDiff#REMOVE} and the delta is also a
	 * move (i.e. the {@link ITwoWayDiff#MOVE_TO} is set). The merge can either
	 * use the {@link #merge(IDiff[], boolean, IProgressMonitor) } method to
	 * accept the rename or perform an
	 * {@link IFile#move(IPath, boolean, boolean, IProgressMonitor) } where the
	 * source file is obtained using {@link IDiff#getPath()} and the destination
	 * is obtained from {@link ITwoWayDiff#getToPath()}. This later approach is
	 * helpful in the case where the local file and remote file both contain
	 * content changes (i.e. the file can be moved by the model and then the
	 * contents can be merged by the model). </li>
	 * 
	 * <li> When the delta kind is {@link IDiff#ADD} and it is not part of a
	 * move, the merger must use the
	 * {@link #merge(IDiff[], boolean, IProgressMonitor) } method to accept this
	 * change. If there is a conflicting addition, the force flag can be set to
	 * override the local change. If the model wishes to keep the local changes,
	 * they can overwrite the file after merging it. Models should consult the
	 * flags to see if the remote change is a rename ({@link ITwoWayDiff#MOVE_FROM}).
	 * </li>
	 * 
	 * <li>When the delta kind is {@link IDiff#REMOVE} and it is not part of a
	 * move, the merger can use the
	 * {@link #merge(IDiff[], boolean, IProgressMonitor) } method but could also
	 * perform the delete manually using any of the {@link IFile} delete
	 * methods. In the case where there are local changes to the file being
	 * deleted, the model may either choose to merge using the force flag (thus
	 * removing the file and the local changes) or call
	 * {@link #markAsMerged(IDiff, boolean, IProgressMonitor) } on the file
	 * which will convert the incoming deletion to an outgoing addition.</li>
	 * 
	 * <li>When the delta kind is {@link IDiff#CHANGE} and there is no
	 * conflict, the model is advised to use the
	 * {@link #merge(IDiff[], boolean, IProgressMonitor) } method to merge these
	 * changes as this is the most efficient means to do so. However, the model
	 * can choose to perform the merge themselves and then invoke
	 * {@link #markAsMerged(IDiff, boolean, IProgressMonitor) } with the
	 * <code>inSyncHint</code> set to <code>true</code> but this will be
	 * less efficient. </li>
	 * 
	 * <li>When the delta kind is {@link IDiff#CHANGE} and there is a conflict,
	 * the model can use the {@link #merge(IDiff[], boolean, IProgressMonitor) }
	 * method to merge these changes. If the force flag is not set, an
	 * auto-merge is attempted using an appropriate {@link IStorageMerger}. If
	 * the force flag is set, the local changes are discarded. The model can
	 * choose to attempt the merge themselves and, if it is successful, invoke
	 * {@link #markAsMerged(IDiff, boolean, IProgressMonitor) } with the
	 * <code>inSyncHint</code> set to <code>false</code> which will make the
	 * file an outgoing change. </li>
