/**
 * A resource variant is a partial implementation of a remote resource
 * whose contents and handle are cached locally. It is assumed that a
 * resource variant is an immutable version or revision of a resource.
 * Therefore, once the contents are cached they cannot be replaced.
 * However, the cached handle can be replaced to allow clients to
 * cache addition state or properties for a resource variant.
 * <p>
 * Overriding subclasses need to provide a cache Id for all their resource variants
 * and a cache path for each resource variant that uniquely identifies it. In addition,
 * they must implement <code>fetchContents</code> to retrieve the contents of the
 * resource variant and then call <code>setContents</code> to place these contents in the cache.
 * Subclasses may also call <code>cacheHandle</code> in order to place the handle in the
 * cache so that it can be retrieved later by calling <code>getCachedHandle</code> on any
 * resource variant whose cache path is the same as the cached handle. This allows subclasses to
 * cache additional resource variant properties such as author, comment, etc.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The <code>IStorage</code> instance returned by this class will be 
 * an {@link org.eclipse.core.resources.IEncodedStorage}.
 * <p>
 * The cache in which the resource variants reside will occasionally clear
 * cached entries if they have not been accessed for a certain amount of time.
 * </p>
