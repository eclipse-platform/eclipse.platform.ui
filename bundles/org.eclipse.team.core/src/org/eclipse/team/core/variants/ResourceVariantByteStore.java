/**
 * The purpose of a <code>ResourceVariantByteStore</code> is to support the caching of
 * the synchronization bytes for the resource variants that represent
 * a resource line-up of interest such as a version, baseline or branch. The
 * cache stores bytes in order to minimize the memory footprint of the tree. It is the
 * responsibility of the client of this API to cache enough bytes to meaningfully identify
 * a resource variant (and possibly create an {@link IResourceVariant} handle from them).
 * <p>
 * The bytes for a resource variant are accessed using the local <code>IResource</code> handle 
 * that corresponds to the resource variant (using the <code>getBytes</code> method). 
 * The potential children of a resource variant are also accessed
 * by using the local handle that corresponds to the resource variant 
 * (using the <code>members</code> method).
