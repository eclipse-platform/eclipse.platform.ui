 * A three-way delta that describe the synchronization state between two

 * contributors as the local and the other as the remote. A three-way delta is
 * represented as a combination of two two-way deltas, one between the ancestor
 * and local and the other between the ancestor and remote. For a three-way
 * delta, clients can assume that the before state of both the local and remote
 * changes are the same.

 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 *              Clients that need to create deltas should instead use
