	 * Returns flags which describe in more detail how a object has been affected.

	 * The following codes (bit masks) are used when kind is <code>CHANGE</code>, and
	 * also when the object is involved in a move:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li><code>CONTENT</code> - The bytes contained by the resource have 
	 * 		been altered.</li>
	 * <li><code>REPLACE</code> - The object
	 *  was deleted (either by a delete or move), and was subsequently re-created
	 *  (either by a create, move, or copy).</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * The following code is only used if kind is <code>REMOVE</code>
	 * (or <code>CHANGE</code> in conjunction with <code>REPLACE</code>):
	 * <ul>
	 * <li><code>MOVE_TO</code> - The object has moved.
	 * 	<code>getToPath</code> will return the path of where it was moved to.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * The following code is only used if kind is <code>ADD</code>
	 * (or <code>CHANGE</code> in conjunction with <code>REPLACE</code>):
	 * <ul>
	 * <li><code>MOVE_FROM</code> - The object has moved.
	 * 	<code>getFromPath</code> will return the path of where it was moved from.</li>
	 * <li><code>COPY_FROM</code> - The object has copied.
	 * 	<code>getFromPath</code> will return the path of where it was copied from.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * A simple move operation would result in the following diff information.
	 * If a object is moved from A to B (with no other changes to A or B), 
	 * then A will have kind <code>REMOVE</code>, with flag <code>MOVE_TO</code>, 
	 * and <code>getToPath</code> on A will return the path for B.  
	 * B will have kind <code>ADD</code>, with flag <code>MOVE_FROM</code>, 
	 * and <code>getFromPath</code> on B will return the path for A.
	 * B's other flags will describe any other changes to the resource, as compared
	 * to its previous location at A.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * Note that the move flags only describe the changes to a single object; they
	 * don't necessarily imply anything about the parent or children of the object.  
	 * If the children were moved as a consequence of a subtree move operation, 
	 * they will have corresponding move flags as well.
