/**
 * A <code>ResourceVariantByteStore</code> that optimizes the memory footprint
 * of a remote resource variant tree by only storing those bytes that differ
 * from a base resource variant tree. This class should only be used for cases
 * where the base and remote are on the same line-of-descent. For example, when
 * the remote tree represents the current state of a branch and the base
 * represents the state of the same branch when the local workspace as last
 * refreshed.
 * <p>
 * This class also contains the logic that allows subclasses to determine if
 * bytes stored in the remote tree are on a different line-of-descent than the
 * base. This is necessary because it is possible for the base tree to change in
 * ways that invalidate the stored remote variants. For example, if the local
 * resources are moved from the main trunk to a branch, any cached remote
 * resource variants would be stale.
