/**
 * A realm defines a context from which objects implementing {@link IObservable}
 * must be accessed, and on which these objects will notify their listeners. To
 * bridge between observables from different realms, subclasses of
 * <code>Binding</code> can be used.
 * <p>
 * A block of code is said to be executing within a realm if calling
 * {@link #isCurrent()} from that block returns true. Code reached by calling
 * methods from that block will execute within the same realm, with the
 * exception of methods on this class that can be used to execute code within a
 * specific realm. Clients can use {@link #syncExec(Runnable)},
 * {@link #asyncExec(Runnable)}, or {@link #exec(Runnable)} to execute a
 * runnable within this realm. Note that using {@link #syncExec(Runnable)} can
 * lead to deadlocks and should be avoided if the current thread holds any
 * locks.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is instructive to think about possible implementations of Realm: It can be
 * based on executing on a designated thread such as a UI thread, or based on
 * holding a lock. In the former case, calling syncExec on a realm that is not
 * the current realm will execute the given runnable on a different thread (the
 * designated thread). In the latter case, calling syncExec may execute the
 * given runnable on the calling thread, but calling
 * {@link #asyncExec(Runnable)} will execute the given runnable on a different
 * thread. Therefore, no assumptions can be made about the thread that will
 * execute arguments to {@link #asyncExec(Runnable)},
 * {@link #syncExec(Runnable)}, or {@link #exec(Runnable)}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is possible that a block of code is executing within more than one realm.
 * This can happen for implementations of Realm that are based on holding a lock
 * but don't use a separate thread to run runnables given to
 * {@link #syncExec(Runnable)}. Realm implementations of this kind should be
 * appropriately documented because it increases the opportunity for deadlock.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Some implementations of {@link IObservable} provide constructors which do not
 * take a Realm argument and are specified to create the observable instance
 * with the current default realm. The default realm can be set for the
 * currently executing thread by using {@link #runWithDefault(Realm, Runnable)}.
 * Note that the default realm does not have to be the current realm.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Subclasses must override at least one of asyncExec()/syncExec(). For realms
 * based on a designated thread, it may be easier to implement asyncExec and
 * keep the default implementation of syncExec. For realms based on holding a
 * lock, it may be easier to implement syncExec and keep the default
 * implementation of asyncExec.
 * </p>
