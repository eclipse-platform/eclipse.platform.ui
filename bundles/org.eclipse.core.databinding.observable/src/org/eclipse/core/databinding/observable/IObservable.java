/**
 * An object with state that allows to listen for state changes.
 *
 * <p>
 * Implementations must not manage listeners themselves, listener management
 * must be delegated to a private instance of type {@link ChangeSupport} if it
 * is not inherited from {@link AbstractObservable}.
 * </p>
 *
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 *              Clients should instead subclass one of the classes that
 *              implement this interface.
 *              <p>
 *              Authors of extensions to the databinding framework may extend
 *              this interface and indirectly implement it, but if doing so must
 *              also extend one of the framework classes. (Use an API problem
 *              filter to suppress the resulting warning.)
 *              <p>
 *              Direct implementers of this interface outside of the framework
 *              will be broken in future releases when methods are added to this
 *              interface.
