/**
 * <p>
 * An object that can exist in one of two states: defined and undefined. This is
 * used by APIs that want to give a handle to an object, even though the object
 * does not fully exist yet. This way, users can attach listeners to objects
 * before they come into existence. It also protects the API from users that do
 * not release references when they should.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To enforce good coding practice, all handle objects must implement
 * <code>equals</code> and <code>toString</code>. Please use
 * <code>string</code> to cache the result for <code>toString</code> once
 * calculated.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * All handle objects are referred to using a single identifier. This identifier
 * is a instance of <code>String</code>. It is important that this identifier
 * remain unique within whatever context that handle object is being used. For
 * example, there should only ever be one instance of <code>Command</code>
 * with a given identifier.
