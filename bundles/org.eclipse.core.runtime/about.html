<h3>Cryptography</h3>

<p><b>Export Control</b></p>
<p>The plug-in contains encryption software.  The country in which you are currently may have restrictions on the import, possession,
and use, and/or re-export to another country, of encryption software.  BEFORE using any encryption software, please check the country's
laws, regulations and policies concerning the import, possession, or use, and re-export of encryption software, to see if this
is permitted.</p>

<p><b>Encryption Items</b></p>

<p>Details of the encryption software in this plug-in are provided to assist in obtaining relevant export control classification and approval.
Cryptography in this plug-in has been classified as Export Commodity Control Number (ECCN) 5D002.c.1 by the U.S. Government Department of Commerce,
Bureau of Export Administration and deemed eligible for export under License Exception Technology Software Unrestricted (TSU) for both object code
and source code.</p>

<p>The plug-in contains a proprietary routine that encrypts and decrypts information used to login to Version Control Management (VCM) repositories.
This routine uses the SHA-1 message digest algorithm implemented in a Java (TM) Runtime Environment (JRE), to generate a cryptographically secure sequence of bytes based on a
user-supplied password combined with bytes supplied by a random number generator.  The secure random numbers generated by this sequence are then added to each byte in the data
to be encrypted. When the data is to be decrypted, the same password will generate the same sequence of random numbers, which is then subtracted from each byte in the encrypted data.
Note that a JRE and therefore the aforementioned SHA-1 message digest code is not included with the plug-in.</p>

<p>The following Java classes contain encryption items (the plug-in may contain both binary and source code):</p>

	<li>org.eclipse.core.internal.runtime.Cipher</li>
