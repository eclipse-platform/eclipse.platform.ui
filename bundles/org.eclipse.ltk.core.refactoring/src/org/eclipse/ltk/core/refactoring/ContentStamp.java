 * A content stamp object represent the content of an <code>IFile</code>.
 * A content stamp object is updated whenever the content of a file
 * changes. In contrast to a time stamp a content stamp is reverted
 * to its previous value if the content of the file is reverted back by
 * performing a corresponding undo change.
 * <p>
 * Clients of the refactoring framework don't need to take care of content
 * stamps. They are managed by the framework itself.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In version 3.0 not all files in the workspace are annotated with a content stamp. The
 * refactoring framework only adds content stamp to those files where necessary. As of
 * version 3.1 the content stamps are mapped to the resource's modification stamp.
