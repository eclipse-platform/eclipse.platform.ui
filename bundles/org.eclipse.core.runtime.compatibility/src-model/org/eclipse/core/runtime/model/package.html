Provides core support for the modeling plug-ins and the plug-in registry.
<h2>Package Specification</h2>
This package specifies the runtime API related to modeling plug-ins and the plug-in
registry.  The types provided here are typically data containers and have very little 
behaviour other than setters and getters.  They are primarily intended for clients writing
tools which manipulate/change registry entries as part of their normal work.
