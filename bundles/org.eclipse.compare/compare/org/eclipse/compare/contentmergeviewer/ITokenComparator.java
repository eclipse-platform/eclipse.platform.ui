/**
 * For performing a so-called "token compare" on a line of text.
 * This interface extends the <code>IRangeComparator</code> interface
 * so that it can be used by the <code>TextMergeViewer</code>.
 * <p>
 * <code>TextMergeViewer</code> activates the token compare when navigating into
 * a range of differing lines. At first the lines are selected as a block.
 * When navigating into this block the token compare shows for every line 
 * the differing token by selecting them.
 * <p>
 * <code>TextMergeViewer</code>'s default token comparator works on characters separated
 * by whitespace. If a different strategy is needed (for example, to use Java tokens in
 * a Java-aware merge viewer), clients may create their own token
 * comparators by implementing this interface (and overriding the
 * <code>TextMergeViewer.createTokenComparator</code> factory method).
 * </p>
