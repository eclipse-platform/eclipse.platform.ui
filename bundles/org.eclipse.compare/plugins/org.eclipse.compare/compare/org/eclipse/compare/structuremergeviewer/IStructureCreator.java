/**
 * Interface used to create a hierarchical structure of
 * <code>IStructureComparator</code>s for a given input object.
 * In addition, it provides methods for locating a path in the hierarchical structure
 * and to map a node of this structure back to the corresponding input object.
 * <p>
 * Structure creators are used in the following contexts:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * the <code>StructureDiffViewer</code> uses an <code>IStructureCreator</code> to
 * build two (or three) tree structures of its input elements (method <code>getStructure</code>).
 * These trees are then compared with each other by means of the differencing engine and displayed
 * with the <code>DiffTreeViewer</code>,
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * the <code>ReplaceWithEditionDialog</code> uses an <code>IStructureCreator</code>
 * to map a path back to a range of characters in the textual representation.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * A <code>IStructureCreator</code> provides methods for rewriting the tree produced by the differencing
 * engine to support "smart" structural differencing. E.g. certain patterns of pairs of "addition"
 * and "deletion" nodes can be detected as renames and merged into a single node.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Clients may implement this interface; there is no standard implementation.
 * </p>

	 * This method is similar to <code>getStructure</code> but in
	 * contrast to <code>getStructure</code> only a single node without any children must be returned.
	 * This method is used in the <code>ReplaceWithEditionDialog</code> to locate a sub element
	 * (e.g. a method) within an input object (e.g. a file containing source code).

	 * One (not optimized) approach to implement this method is calling <code>getStructure(input)</code>
	 * to build the full tree, and then finding that node within the tree that is specified
	 * by <code>path</code>.

	 * The syntax of <code>path</code> is not specified, because it is treated by the compare subsystem
	 * as an opaque entity and is not further interpreted. Clients using this functionality
	 * will pass a value of <code>path</code> to the <code>selectEdition</code>
	 * method of <code>ReplaceWithEditionDialog</code> and will receive this value unchanged
	 * as an argument to <code>locate</code>.
