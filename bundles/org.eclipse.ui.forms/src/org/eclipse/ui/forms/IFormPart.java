/**
 * Classes that implement this interface can be added to the managed form and
 * take part in the form life cycle. The part is initialized with the form and
 * will be asked to accept focus. The part can receive form input and can elect
 * to do something according to it (for example, select an object that matches
 * the input).
 * <p>
 * The form part has two 'out of sync' states in respect to the model(s) that
 * feed the form: <b>dirty</b> and <b>stale</b>. When a part is dirty, it
 * means that the user interacted with it and now its widgets contain state that
 * is newer than the model. In order to sync up with the model, 'commit' needs
 * to be called. In contrast, the model can change 'under' the form (as a result
 * of some actions outside the form), resulting in data in the model being
 * 'newer' than the content presented in the form. A 'stale' form part is
 * brought in sync with the model by calling 'refresh'. The part is responsible
 * for notifying the form when one of these states change in the part. The form
 * reserves the right to handle this notification in the most appropriate way
 * for the situation (for example, if the form is in a page of the multi-page
 * editor, it may do nothing for stale parts if the page is currently not
 * showing).
 * <p>
 * When the form is disposed, each registered part is disposed as well. Parts
 * are responsible for releasing any system resources they created and for
 * removing themselves as listeners from all event providers.
