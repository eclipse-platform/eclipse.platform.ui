Application programming interfaces for interaction
with and extension of the Eclipse Platform User Interface.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
This package provides application programming interfaces for interaction
with and extension of the Eclipse Platform User Interface.
<p>The <b>PlatformUI</b> class provides access to a single <b>workbench</b>.&nbsp;
A workbench is the root object for the UI and has one or more <b>workbench
windows</b>.&nbsp; Each workbench window has a collection of <b>workbench
pages</b>, only one of which is active and visible to the end user.&nbsp;
Each workbench page has a collection of <b>workbench parts.&nbsp; </b>A
page's parts are arranged (tiled or stacked) for presentation on the screen.&nbsp;
Within a page and its parts the user can interact with and modify a model
(typically resources in a workspace).&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two kinds of
workbench parts: views and editors.&nbsp; An editor is typically used to
edit or browse a document or input object.&nbsp; A view is typically used
to navigate a hierarchy of information (like the workspace), open an editor,
or display properties for the active editor.
<p>The platform creates a workbench when the workbench plug-in is activated.&nbsp;
Since this happens at most once during the life of the running platform,
there is only one workbench instance. Due to its singular nature, it is
commonly referred to as <i>the</i> workbench.
<p>Within a workbench the user will interact with many different resource
types.&nbsp; Because different tools are required for each, the workbench
defines a number of extension points which allow for the integration of
new tools.&nbsp; There are extension points for views, editors, action
sets, import wizards, export wizards, etc.
