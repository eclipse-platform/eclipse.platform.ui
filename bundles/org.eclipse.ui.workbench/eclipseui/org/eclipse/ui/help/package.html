Classes for integration with the help support system
in the Eclipse Platform User Interface.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
Within the Eclipse Platform UI each user interface component should integrate
with the help support system.&nbsp; The simplest form of help integration
is accomplished using <b>WorkbenchHelp</b>.&nbsp; This class provides the
client with methods to define a help context for SWT Controls.&nbsp; Once
defined, the help support system will automatically launch help with the
appropriate context if a user request for help occurs.
