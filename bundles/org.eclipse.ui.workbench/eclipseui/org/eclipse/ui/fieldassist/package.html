Package Specification</h2>
This package provides workbench-level utilities that use the JFace-level
field assist support.  It includes the WorkbenchContentAssistAdapter, which
can invoke content assistance using a command and key binding rather than
specifying the invocation explicitly with a KeyStroke.
