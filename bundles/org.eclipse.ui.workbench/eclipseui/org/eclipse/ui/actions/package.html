Classes for actions and operations used in a workbench
window, page, or part in the Eclipse Platform User Interface.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
Actions for resource management, project build and workbench page management
are provided to encourage a standard look and feel across views and editors
contributed by independent system vendors. Base classes are also provided
for selection oriented actions which enable or disable based upon selection
in a part or viewer. These should be used by ISV's to define actions for
menus, toolbars, and context menus.
<p>Action which leads to resource modification should take advantage of
the <code>WorkspaceModifyOperation</code> classes. These classes are
used to defer events which typically occur as a result of workspace changes
(such as the firing of resource deltas, performance of autobuilds, etc.)
until the outermost operation has successfully completed. This deferral
leads to an optimized, faster execution of resource modification because
fewer deltas and autobuilds are performed.
