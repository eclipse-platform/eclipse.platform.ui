/**
 * Web browser support. This class allows you to open URLs using internal or
 * external Web browsers. Implementers may provide varying levels of support.
 * The most rudimentary support that must be provided is to open URLs in an
 * external web browser window. Everything else is a hint that browser support
 * implementation may choose to honor but is not required (although a good
 * implementation should aspire to support all the styles if possible on the
 * given platform).
 * <p>
 * The support has a two-phase approach to opening URLs. A browser instance is
 * created first, then <code>openURL</code> is called on it. This provides for
 * browser instance reuse for as long as needed. The step of creating the
 * browser instance encourages reuse itself by not creating new instances of
 * browsers if one with the same id is already open. It also makes it possible
 * to reuse browser instances restored after workbench is restarted.
 * <p>
 * The simplest way to open a URL is:
 *
 * <pre>
 * IWorkbenchSupport.createBrowser(&quot;myId&quot;).openURL(url);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The call above will show the provided URL by reusing the browser instance
 * with the matching id, or creating a new one if one does not exist already.
 * <p>
 * When more advanced control over the behavior of a browser instance is
 * required, it is recommended to create the instance first, then reuse it as
 * needed.
 * <p>
 * This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 *
 * @see IWebBrowser
 * @since 3.1
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * @noextend This interface is not intended to be extended by clients.
