/**
 * An editor is a visual component within a workbench page. It is typically used
 * to edit or browse a document or input object. The input is identified using
 * an <code>IEditorInput</code>. Modifications made in an editor part follow an
 * open-save-close lifecycle model (in contrast to a view part, where
 * modifications are saved to the workbench immediately).
 * <p>
 * An editor is document or input-centric. Each editor has an input, and only
 * one editor can exist for each editor input within a page. This policy has
 * been designed to simplify part management.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An editor should be used in place of a view whenever more than one instance
 * of a document type can exist.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface may be implemented directly. For convenience, a base
 * implementation is defined in <code>EditorPart</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An editor part is added to the workbench in two stages:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>An editor extension is contributed to the workbench registry. This
 * extension defines the extension id, extension class, and the file extensions
 * which are supported by the editor.</li>
 * <li>An editor part based upon the extension is created and added to the
 * workbench when the user opens a file with one of the supported file
 * extensions (or some other suitable form of editor input).</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * All editor parts implement the <code>IAdaptable</code> interface; extensions
 * are managed by the platform's adapter manager.
 * </p>
 *
 * @see org.eclipse.ui.IWorkbenchPage#openEditor(IEditorInput, String)
