/**
 * A perspective factory generates the initial page layout and visible action
 * set for a page.
 * <p>
 * When a new page is created in the workbench a perspective is used to define
 * the initial page layout. If this is a predefined perspective (based on an
 * extension to the workbench's perspective extension point) an
 * <code>IPerspectiveFactory</code> is used to define the initial page layout.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The factory for the perspective is created and passed an
 * <code>IPageLayout</code> where views can be added. The default layout
 * consists of the editor area with no additional views. Additional views are
 * added to the layout using the editor area as the initial point of reference.
 * The factory is used only briefly while a new page is created; then discarded.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To define a perspective clients should implement this interface and include
 * the name of their class in an extension to the workbench's perspective
 * extension point (named <code>"org.eclipse.ui.perspectives"</code>). For
 * example, the plug-in's XML markup might contain:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * &lt;extension point="org.eclipse.ui.perspectives"&gt;
 *   &lt;perspective
 *       id="com.example.javaplugin.perspective"
 *       name="Java"
 *       class="com.example.javaplugin.JavaPerspective"&gt;
 *   &lt;/perspective&gt;
 * &lt;/extension&gt;
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Example of populating a page with standard workbench views:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * public void createInitialLayout(IPageLayout layout) {
 * 	// Get the editor area.
 * 	String editorArea = layout.getEditorArea();
 *
 * 	// Top left: Resource Navigator view and Bookmarks view placeholder
 * 	IFolderLayout topLeft = layout.createFolder("topLeft", IPageLayout.LEFT, 0.25f, editorArea);
 * 	topLeft.addView(IPageLayout.ID_PROJECT_EXPLORER);
 * 	topLeft.addPlaceholder(IPageLayout.ID_BOOKMARKS);
 *
 * 	// Bottom left: Outline view and Property Sheet view
 * 	IFolderLayout bottomLeft = layout.createFolder("bottomLeft", IPageLayout.BOTTOM, 0.50f, "topLeft");
 * 	bottomLeft.addView(IPageLayout.ID_OUTLINE);
 * 	bottomLeft.addView(IPageLayout.ID_PROP_SHEET);
 *
 * 	// Bottom right: Task List view
 * 	layout.addView(IPageLayout.ID_TASK_LIST, IPageLayout.BOTTOM, 0.66f, editorArea);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Within the workbench a user may override the visible views, layout and action
 * sets of a predefined perspective to create a custom perspective. In such
 * cases the layout is persisted by the workbench and the factory is not used.
 * </p>
