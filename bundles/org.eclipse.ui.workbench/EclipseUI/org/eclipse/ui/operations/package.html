Classes that provide the basic workbench UI support for undo and redo of
operations. 
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
This package provides utilities that implement the common function for interacting
with the workbench operation history.  The <b>workbench operation support</b> provides 
access to the operation history used by the workbench and a context that should
be used to identify operations global to the workbench.  The workbench history is used 
to maintain all undoable operations that occur in the workbench.  Standard action 
handlers and an associated action group are provided so that any view or editor 
can easily add undo/redo support that works with the workbench operations history. 
Specialized <b>operation approvers</b> can be used by clients to get user approval
for unexpected conditions in the operation history.
