Classes for the creation of workbench parts that integrate
with the Eclipse Platform User Interface.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
A <b>workbench part</b> is a visual component within a <b>workbench page</b>.&nbsp;
There are two types: <b>view</b> and <b>editor</b>, as defined by <code>IViewPart</code>
and <code>IEditorPart</code>.&nbsp;&nbsp; An editor is typically used to edit
or browse a document or input object.&nbsp; A view is typically used to
navigate a hierarchy of information (like the workspace), open an editor,
or display properties for the active editor.&nbsp; This package provides
a base implementation for the definition of views and editors.
