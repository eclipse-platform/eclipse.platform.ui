/**
 * <p>
 * An instance of <code>ICommand</code> is a handle representing a command as
 * defined by the extension point <code>org.eclipse.ui.commands</code>. The
 * identifier of the handle is identifier of the command being represented.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An instance of <code>ICommand</code> can be obtained from an instance of
 * <code>ICommandManager</code> for any identifier, whether or not a command
 * with that identifier defined in the plugin registry.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The handle-based nature of this API allows it to work well with runtime
 * plugin activation and deactivation. If a command is defined, that means that
 * its corresponding plug-in is active. If the plug-in is then deactivated, the
 * command will still exist but it will be undefined. An attempts to use an
 * undefined command will result in a <code>NotDefinedException</code> being
 * thrown.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface is not intended to be extended or implemented by clients.
 * </p>
 *

 * @see ICommandListener
 * @see ICommandManager
 * @see org.eclipse.core.commands.Command
 * @deprecated Please use the "org.eclipse.core.commands" plug-in instead. This
 *             API is scheduled for deletion, see Bug 431177 for details
