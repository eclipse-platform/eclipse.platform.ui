 * Plug-ins that register a startup extension will be activated after the
 * Workbench initializes and have an opportunity to run code that can't be
 * implemented using the normal contribution mechanisms.
 * <p>
 * Users can disable the execution of specific extensions in their workspace's
 * preferences via<br>
 * {@code  General -> Startup and Shutdown -> Plug-ins activated on startup}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Instead of implementing this interface and registering the implementation as
 * Eclipse-Extension, handlers that want to be notified upon application
 * start-up can be registered declaratively as OSGi
 * {@link org.osgi.service.event.EventHandler} service for the
 * {@link org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.UIEvents.UILifeCycle#APP_STARTUP_COMPLETE}
 * event.<br>
 * Such an event-handler is always executed and cannot be disabled via a
 * preferences.
 * <p>
 * For example a class
 *
 * <pre>
 * public class MyStartupHandler implements IStartup {
 * 	&#64;Override
 * 	public void earlyStartup() {
 * 		// do handling...
 * 	}
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * can be rewritten to
 *
 * <pre>
 * &#64;Component(service = EventHandler.class)
 * &#64;EventTopics(UIEvents.UILifeCycle.APP_STARTUP_COMPLETE)
 * public class MyStartupHandler implements EventHandler {
 * 	&#64;Override
 * 	public void handleEvent(Event event) {
 * 		// do handling...
 * 	}
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Processing of OSGi declarative services annotations has to be enabled for the
 * containing Plug-in and it has to import the package
 * {@code org.osgi.service.event} and
 * {@code org.osgi.service.event.propertytypes} as well as a dependency to
 * {@code org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench}. At the same time the registration of the
 * handler as Eclipse Extension for the {@code org.eclipse.ui.startup}
 * extension-point can be removed.
