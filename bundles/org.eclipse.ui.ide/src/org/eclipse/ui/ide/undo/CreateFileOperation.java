/**
 * A CreateFileOperation represents an undoable operation for creating a file in

 * and the entire containment path of the file will be created if it does not
 * exist.  The file should not already exist, and the existence of the
 * containment path should not be changed between the time this operation
 * is created and the time it is executed.
