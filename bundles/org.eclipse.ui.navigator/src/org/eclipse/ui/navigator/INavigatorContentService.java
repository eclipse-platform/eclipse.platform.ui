/**
 *
 * Manages content extensions for extensible viewers and provides reusable
 * services for filters, sorting, the activation of content extensions, and DND.
 * The service can locate the appropriate providers (for contents or labels) for
 * an element and provide a ready-to-go {@link ITreeContentProvider} and
 * {@link ILabelProvider} for viewers that wish to take advantage of the
 * <b>org.eclipse.ui.navigator.navigatorContent</b> extensions defined for a
 * particular <i>viewerId</i>.
 *
 * <p>
 * Clients can get the instance of this associated with the
 * {@link CommonNavigator} using
 * {@link CommonNavigator#getNavigatorContentService()}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Clients may contribute logical extensions using
 * <b>org.eclipse.ui.navigator.navigatorContent</b>. Each extension has three
 * states which determine whether the extension is used by the content service:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>visible</i>: If a content extension id matches a
 * <b>viewerContentBinding</b> for the <i>viewerId</i> of this content service,
 * then the extension is <i>visible</i>. Visible extensions may only be
 * configured through <b>viewerContentBinding</b>s.</li>
 *
 * <li><i>active</i>: The active state may be set to a default using the
 * <i>activeByDefault</i> attribute of <b>navigatorContent</b>. Users may toggle
 * the <i>active</i> state through the "Filters and Customization" dialog.
 * Clients may also configure the active extensions using
 * {@link INavigatorActivationService#activateExtensions(String[], boolean)} or
 * {@link INavigatorActivationService#deactivateExtensions(String[], boolean)}
 * from the {@link #getActivationService() Activation Service}</li>
 *
 * <li><i>enabled</i>: An extension is <i>enabled</i> for an element if the
 * extension contributed that element or if the element is described in the
 * <i>triggerPoints</i> element of the <b>navigatorContent</b> extension. The
 * findXXX() methods search for <i>enabled</i> extensions.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * A new instance of the content service should be created for each viewer.
 * Clients should use {@link #createCommonContentProvider()} and
 * {@link #createCommonLabelProvider()} for the viewer. Each content service
 * tracks the viewer it is attached to. Clients may create the content service
 * with a viewer using
 * ({@link NavigatorContentServiceFactory#createContentService(String)}).
 * Alternatively, when the content provider is created and set on a viewer,
 * {@link IContentProvider#inputChanged(org.eclipse.jface.viewers.Viewer, Object, Object)}
 * will be called and the content provider will update the viewer used by its
 * backing content service. Therefore, only each content service has exactly one
 * content provider and one label provider.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Extensions may also coordinate their behavior through a
 * {@link IExtensionStateModel state model}. The state model holds properties
 * and supports property change listeners. Actions can toggle the setting of
 * properties and the corresponding content/label providers will respond to
 * property change event. Each <b>navigatorContent</b> extension has its own
 * contained state model keyed off of the content extension id.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Clients may respond when content extensions are loaded by attaching a
 * {@link INavigatorContentServiceListener} to the content service.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Some extensions may provide content or label providers which implement
 * {@link IMemento}. Clients must call {@link #restoreState(IMemento)} and
 * {@link #saveState(IMemento)} at the appropriate times for these extensions to
 * prepare themselves with the memento.
 * </p>
 *
 * @since 3.2
 * @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
 * @noextend This interface is not intended to be extended by clients.
