/**
 * <p>
 * Used by the
 * <b>org.eclipse.ui.navigator.navigatorContent/navigatorContent/commonDropAdapter</b>
 * extension point to carry out pluggable drop operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Each {@link CommonDropAdapterAssistant} is contained by single content
 * extension. The opportunity for each assistant to handle the drop operation is
 * determined by the <b>possibleChildren</b> expression of the
 * <b>org.eclipse.ui.navigator.navigatorContent/navigatorContent</b> extension;
 * whenever every element in the drag set matches the <b>possibleChildren</b>
 * expression of an extension, it is eligible to handle the drop operation. This
 * initial set is further culled using the <b>possibleDropTargets</b> expression
 * of the <b>commonDropAdapter</b> using the current drop target.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If drag operations originate outside of Eclipse, then the set of eligible
 * drop adapters is determined based on the drop target (using the
 * <b>possibleDropTargets</b> expression). Each assistant can then indicate
 * whether {@link #isSupportedType(TransferData) the incoming type is
 * supported}.
 * <p>
 * Whenever a match is found, the assistant will be given an opportunity to
 * first {@link #validateDrop(Object, int, TransferData)}, and then if the
 * assistant returns true, the assist must
 * {@link #handleDrop(CommonDropAdapter, DropTargetEvent, Object)}. If multiple
 * assistants match the drop target, then the potential assistants are ordered
 * based on priority and their override relationships and given an opportunity
 * to validate the drop operation in turn. The first one to validate will have
 * the opportunty to carry out the drop.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Clients may handle DND operations that begin and end in the current viewer by
 * overriding the following methods:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #validateDrop(Object, int, TransferData)}: Indicate whether this
 * assistant can handle a drop onto the current viewer.</li>
 * <li>{@link #handleDrop(CommonDropAdapter, DropTargetEvent, Object)}: Handle
 * the drop operation onto the current viewer.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * If a user originates a drag operation to another viewer that cannot handle
 * one of the available drag transfer types, drop assistants may handle the drop
 * operation for the target viewer. Clients must override :
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #validatePluginTransferDrop(IStructuredSelection, Object)}:
 * Indicate whether this assistant can handle the drop onto another viewer.
 * <li>{@link #handlePluginTransferDrop(IStructuredSelection, Object)}: Handle
 * the drop operation onto the other viewer.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Clients may subclass this.
