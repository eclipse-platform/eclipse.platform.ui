/**
 *
 * A pipelined content provider allows an extension to reshape the contributions
 * of an upstream content extension.
 *
 * An "upstream" extension is either:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the extension overridden by this extension using the
 * <b>org.eclipse.ui.navigatorContent/navigatorContent/override</b> element, or</li>
 * <li>another extension that overrides the same extension this extension
 * overrides, but with higher priority than this extension.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Overridden extensions form a tree where the nodes of the tree represent the
 * content extensions, children represent overriding extensions, and the
 * children are sorted by priority. Pipeline contributions traverse the tree,
 * allowing children to override the contributions of their parent, giving
 * precedence to the children of highest priority.
 *
 * {@link ITreeContentProvider} is respected by the Common Navigator.
 *
 * Note: this should be used instead of {@link IPipelinedTreeContentProvider} so
 * that the hasChildren indication reflects the actual pipelined children that
 * will be presented.
 *
 * @see INavigatorPipelineService
 * @see INavigatorContentService#getPipelineService()
