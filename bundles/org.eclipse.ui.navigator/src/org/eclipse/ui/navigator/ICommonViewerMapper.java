/**
 * Allows improved performance by optimizing label updates of the CommonViewer.
 *
 * Often label updates come in the form of resource updates, and the resources
 * themselves are not directly stored in the {@link CommonViewer}; instead other model
 * objects are stored.  In addition, it may be the case where the objects that
 * have changed are not present in the Tree associated with the CommonViewer
 * because they have not been opened or expanded.
 *
 * You can use an instance of this class to define a mapping between the current
 * Tree Items associated with the CommonViewer and the (typically resource) objects
 * where a change is notified.  The change is notified to the
 * {@link CommonViewer#handleLabelProviderChanged(org.eclipse.jface.viewers.LabelProviderChangedEvent)}.
 *
 * The mapper object (implementing this interface) is associated with the CommonViewer using
 * the {@link CommonViewer#setMapper(ICommonViewerMapper)} method.
 *
 * When this mapper wishes to update the CommonViewer, the
 * {@link CommonViewer#doUpdateItem(org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Widget)}
 * method is used.
 *
 * @since 3.4
 * @noextend This interface is not intended to be extended by clients.
