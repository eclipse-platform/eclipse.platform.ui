 * Externally, a <code>DeltaDataTree</code> appears to have the same content as
 * a standard data tree.  Internally, the delta tree may be complete, or it may
 * just indicate the changes between itself and its parent.  
 *
 * <p>Nodes that exist in the parent but do not exist in the delta, are represented 
 * as instances of <code>DeletedNode</code>.  Nodes that are identical in the parent
 * and the delta, but have differences in their subtrees, are represented as
 * instances of <code>NoDataDeltaNode</code> in the delta tree.  Nodes that differ
 * between parent and delta are instances of <code>DataDeltaNode</code>.  However,
 * the <code>DataDeltaNode</code> only contains the children whose subtrees differ
 * between parent and delta.
 *
 * A delta tree algebra is used to manipulate sets of delta trees.  Given two trees,
 * one can obtain the delta between the two using the method 
 * <code>forwardDeltaWith(aTree)</code>.  Given a tree and a delta, one can assemble
 * the complete tree that the delta represents using the method <code>
 * assembleWithForwardDelta</code>.  Refer to the public API methods of this class
