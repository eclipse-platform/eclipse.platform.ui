/**
 * A pool of Strings for doing prefix checks against multiple
 * candidates.
 * <p>
 * Allows to enter a list of Strings, and then perform the
 * following checks:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #containsAsPrefix(String)} - check whether a given
 *       String s is a prefix of any String in the pool.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #hasPrefixOf(String)} - check whether any String
 *       in the pool is a prefix of the given String s.
 * </ul>
 * The prefix pool is always kept normalized, i.e. no element of
 * the pool is a prefix of any other element in the pool. In order
 * to maintain this constraint, there are two methods for adding
 * Strings to the pool:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #insertLonger(String)} - add a String s to the pool,
 *       and remove any existing prefix of s from the pool.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #insertShorter(String)} - add a String s to the pool,
 *       and remove any existing Strings sx from the pool which
 *       contain s as prefix.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The PrefixPool grows as needed when adding Strings. Typically,
 * it is used for prefix checks on absolute paths of a tree.
 * </p><p>
 * This class is not thread-safe: no two threads may add or
 * check items at the same time.
