/**
 * Appends data, in chunks, to a file. Each chunk is defined by the moment
 * the stream is opened (created) and a call to #succeed is made. It is
 * necessary to use the <code>SafeChunkyInputStream</code> to read its
 * contents back. The user of this class does not need to know explicitly about
 * its chunk implementation.
 * It is only an implementation detail. What really matters to the outside
 * world is that it tries to keep the file data consistent.
 * If some data becomes corrupted while writing or later, upon reading
 * the file, the chunk that contains the corrupted data is skipped.
 * <p>
 * Because of this class purpose (keep data consistent), it is important that the
 * user only calls <code>#succeed</code> when the chunk of data is successfully
 * written. After this call, the user can continue writing data to the file and it
 * will not be considered related to the previous chunk. So, if this data is
 * corrupted, the previous one is still safe.
