Provides APIs for integrating application models with the workspace

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>
This package specifies the APIs in the Resources plug-in that are used to integrate
application models with the workspace.  This API introduces the notion of a 
<tt>ResourceMapping</tt> that defines the relationship between an application
model object and a set of underlying resources, and a <tt>ResourceTraversal</tt>
that describes the exact resources corresponding to a given application model object.
The relationship between an application model and underlying resources can vary
depending a <i>context</i>.  This notion is captured by <tt>ResourceMappingContext</tt>
and its subclasses.
