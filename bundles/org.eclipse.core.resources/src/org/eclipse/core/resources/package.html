Provides basic support for managing a workspace and
its resources.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
This package specifies the principal API for the Resources plug-in.&nbsp;
The resources plug-in defines the notions of <tt>Workspaces</tt> and <tt>Resources</tt>.&nbsp;
The workspace's resource model is very similar to a file system.&nbsp;
All resources are backed by a real file or directory in some backing file
system.&nbsp; They are stored in their native form (i.e., no extra bytes
or markup) using their normal names.
<p>In addition to basic resource management, the Resources plug-in supports
various workspace lifecycle events such as save and snapshot, and resource
change events.
