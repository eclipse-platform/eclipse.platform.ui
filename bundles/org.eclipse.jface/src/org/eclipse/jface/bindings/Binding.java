/**
 * <p>
 * A binding is a link between user input and the triggering of a particular
 * command. The most common example of a binding is a keyboard shortcut, but
 * there are also mouse and gesture bindings.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Bindings are linked to particular conditions within the application. Some of
 * these conditions change infrequently (e.g., locale, scheme), while some will
 * tend to change quite frequently (e.g., context). This allows the bindings to
 * be tailored to particular situations. For example, a set of bindings may be
 * appropriate only inside a text editor. Or, perhaps, a set of bindings might
 * be appropriate only for a given locale, such as bindings that coexist with
 * the Input Method Editor (IME) on Chinese locales.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is also possible to remove a particular binding. This is typically done as
 * part of user configuration (e.g., user changing keyboard shortcuts). However,
 * it can also be helpful when trying to change a binding on a particular locale
 * or platform. An "unbinding" is really just a binding with no command
 * identifier. For it to unbind a particular binding, it must match that binding
 * in its context identifier and scheme identifier. Subclasses (e.g.,
 * <code>KeyBinding</code>) may require other properties to match (e.g.,
 * <code>keySequence</code>). If these properties match, then this is an
 * unbinding. Note: the locale and platform can be different.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, imagine you have a key binding that looks like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * KeyBinding(command, scheme, context, &quot;Ctrl+Shift+F&quot;)
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * On GTK+, the "Ctrl+Shift+F" interferes with some native behaviour. To change
 * the binding, we first unbind the "Ctrl+Shift+F" key sequence by assigning it
 * a null command on the gtk platform. We then create a new binding that maps
 * the command to the "Esc Ctrl+F" key sequence.
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 *     KeyBinding("Ctrl+Shift+F",null,scheme,context,null,gtk,null,SYSTEM)
 *     KeyBinding("Esc Ctrl+F",parameterizedCommand,scheme,context,null,gtk,SYSTEM)
 * </code>
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Bindings are intended to be immutable objects.
 * </p>
