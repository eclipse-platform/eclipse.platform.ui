/**
 * Wrapper for a virtual-table-like widget. Contains all methods needed for lazy updates.
 * The JFace algorithms for deferred or lazy content providers should talk to this class
 * instead of directly to a TableViewer. This will allow them to be used with other virtual
 * viewers and widgets in the future.
 *
 * <p>
 * For example, if SWT starts to support virtual Lists in the future, it should be possible
 * to create an adapter from <code>AbstractVirtualTable</code> to <code>ListViewer</code> in
 * order to reuse the existing algorithms for deferred updates.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This is package visibility by design. It would only need to be made public if there was
 * a demand to use the deferred content provider algorithms like
 * <code>BackgroundContentProvider</code> with non-JFace viewers.
