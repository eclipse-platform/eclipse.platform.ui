/**
 * A document partitioner divides a document into a set
 * of disjoint text partitions. Each partition has a content type, an
 * offset, and a length. The document partitioner is connected to one document
 * and informed about all changes of this document before any of the
 * document's document listeners. A document partitioner can thus
 * incrementally update on the receipt of a document change event.<p>
 *
 * In order to provided backward compatibility for clients of <code>IDocumentPartitioner</code>, extension
 * interfaces are used to provide a means of evolution. The following extension interfaces
 * exist:
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@link org.eclipse.jface.text.IDocumentPartitionerExtension} since version 2.0 replacing
 *      the <code>documentChanged</code> method with a new one returning the minimal document region
 *      comprising all partition changes.</li>
 * <li> {@link org.eclipse.jface.text.IDocumentPartitionerExtension2} since version 3.0
 *      introducing zero-length partitions in conjunction with the distinction between
 *      open and closed partitions. Also provides inside in the implementation of the partitioner
 *      by exposing the position category used for managing the partitioning information.</li>
 * <li> {@link org.eclipse.jface.text.IDocumentPartitionerExtension3} since version 3.1 introducing
 *      rewrite session. It also replaces the existing {@link #connect(IDocument)} method with
 *      a new one: {@link org.eclipse.jface.text.IDocumentPartitionerExtension3#connect(IDocument, boolean)}.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Clients may implement this interface and its extension interfaces or use the standard
 * implementation <code>FastPartitioner</code>.
 * </p>
